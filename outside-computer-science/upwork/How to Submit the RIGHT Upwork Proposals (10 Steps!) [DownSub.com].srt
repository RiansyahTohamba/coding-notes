1
00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:02,844
(water running)

2
00:00:02,844 --> 00:00:06,590
(bass thumping beat)

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,640
- Do you hear that?

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,090
That's the sound of all
your Upwork connects

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,360
going down the drain,

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,600
because you're submitting
the wrong job proposals.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,550
But don't worry, 'cause in this video,

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,930
I'm gonna give you 10 steps,

9
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,990
10 steps that you can implement

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,040
to help you save your Upwork connects,

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,183
and to ultimately, submit
the right job proposals.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,130
If you've been freelancing on Upwork,

13
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,090
then you're aware of the
recent connects policy change.

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,460
This new policy changes how
Upwork connects are required

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,110
when you're submitting a job proposal,

16
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,860
and also increases the price of connects

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,260
if you are to run out of them,
and want to purchase more.

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,080
So now when you submit a
proposal, it's going to require

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,480
one to six connects,
and that's gonna depend

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,730
on the specific job, so the type of job,

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,450
the estimated value of the
job, the duration, the budget.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,900
All those things are gonna factor in

23
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,270
to how many connects are required.

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,170
For example, say you have a
job with the budget of $40.

25
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,710
and you have one with $1,000.

26
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,080
The job that has $1,000 budget

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,530
is gonna require more
connects than the $40 budget,

28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,129
and then for the price of Upwork connects,

29
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,430
those were increased to 15 cents apiece,

30
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,060
so if you run out of your Upwork connects,

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,280
and you want to purchase more,

32
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,710
they're gonna be 15 cents each.

33
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,440
So I know your initial thought may be,

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,540
Upwork's just doing
this to make more money.

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,210
They're just trying to
increase the prices,

36
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,020
make it more difficult freelancers,

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,020
and make more money.

38
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,590
But let me a perspective that
you need to be thinking about

39
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,790
from a client perspective.

40
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,840
One of the main issues for Upwork clients

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,460
is feeling overwhelmed
and not being able to find

42
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,970
the best talent because
of how many job proposals

43
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,630
are being submitted for their jobs.

44
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,200
When a client has to scroll through

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,090
numerous amounts of job proposals,

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,950
trying to find the best fit for them,

47
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,410
it gets overwhelming when they're having

48
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,540
to go through so many.

49
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,600
Trust me, I have an
Upwork employer account,

50
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,610
so I know that a lot of job
proposals that come through,

51
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,910
should not be coming through.

52
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,540
A lot of them aren't taking
the time they need to take

53
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,353
to make sure they're applying for the jobs

54
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:53,570
that give them the best chance
to actually win the job.

55
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,340
They're going through with low effort,

56
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,800
submitting a bunch of proposals,

57
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,580
thinking that hey, if I submit
a large number of proposals,

58
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,900
I'm gonna get one of these jobs.

59
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,920
That does not work, and
you're never gonna get a job,

60
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,940
if that's your mindset.

61
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,300
So when you think about
this connect policy change,

62
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,960
think about it in terms of the client,

63
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,470
and yourself as a freelancer.

64
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,510
It's beneficial for both ends.

65
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,120
The client won't have to scroll through

66
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,740
as many job proposals from
a bunch of freelancers,

67
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,370
who shouldn't even be
bidding on their job,

68
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,930
and therefore, your
benefit as a freelancer,

69
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,110
your job proposal is
gonna be ranked higher

70
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,780
because you're gonna
be submitting proposals

71
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,220
on jobs that best fit
your skills, best fit the

72
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,460
requirements, and it's gonna
give you a better chance

73
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,380
to rank higher and be
noticed by the clients,

74
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,580
so in this video what I'm doing for you,

75
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,970
is I'm gonna give you 10 steps to take

76
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,610
before you submit a job proposal.

77
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,910
These 10 steps are gonna make sure

78
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,130
that you're submitting
the right job proposals

79
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,230
to give you the best chance to win a job

80
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,560
over other freelancers.

81
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,350
Before we get into the 10
steps, I ask one thing of you

82
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,700

then you can download a free PDF checklist

93
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,650
that's gonna have a lot of the steps

94
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,470
that we're talking
about here in this video

95
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,820
for submitting a job proposal.

96
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,520
It's a checklist that you can go through

97
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,450
each time that you're
submitting a job proposal

98
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,140
to make sure that you're
not skipping anything,

99
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,410
so again it's completely free,

100
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,550
it's down in the
description of this video,

101
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,383
just click on the link.

102
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:25,740
It'll take you to a web page,

103
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,607
you enter your email address,

104
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,750
and then you can download it.

105
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,130
Step number one, fully read the job title

106
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,400
and the job description.

107
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,570
After coming across a job title

108
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,910
that falls within your skill set

109
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,590
and looks like something you can do,

110
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,590
make sure that you're reading
the entire job description,

111
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,560
the full job description,
read it all in detail.

112
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,410
Sure, I get it.

113
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,000
This is something everyone should know,

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,150
but it's something
that's easily overlooked,

115
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,670
and I know that from my
own personal experience.

116
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,980
In my early days freelancing on Upwork

117
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,940
I focused way too
heavily on the job title,

118
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,120
I would apply for jobs

119
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,780
without reading the full job description

120
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,960
because I saw the title,

121
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,390
and it looked like something I could do.

122
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,820
So what ended up happening
as a consequence,

123
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,440
I either never heard back from the client,

124
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,040
never got an interview,
or I got an interview,

125
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,110
and we got on a phone call,

126
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,240
and I realized I didn't
have all the skill set

127
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,810
that they needed because
I didn't go through

128
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,030
the full job description,

129
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,079
and I know that if you've
been on Upwork for a while,

130
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,889
you know exactly what I'm talking about,

131
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,200
you'll see a job title.

132
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,910
Oh this is perfect, this
is definitely something

133
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,230
that's within my skill set.

134
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,530
I'll find something that says like

135
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,540
sequel server database administration,

136
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,491
and then I go and read
the job description,

137
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:28,680
and then there's things in there

138
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,450
like wanting to build a
front end application,

139
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,440
in C#, obviously does not fall

140
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,230
within the database aspect of it.

141
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,750
I know that you guys that have
been freelancing for a while,

142
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,830
know what I'm talking about.

143
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,330
So make sure that you're
reading the full job description

144
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,030
in detail, to save connects,

145
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,830
so you don't bid on jobs that
you don't have the skills for,

146
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,927
end up wasting your connects,

147
00:04:45,927 --> 00:04:48,110
and wasting your time doing an interview,

148
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,959
you can applying that to a jobs

149
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,910
that you're actually qualified for,

150
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,260
and have the skill set for.

151
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,510
Make sure that you're reading
the full job description

152
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,170
to save your connects, and
on top of saving connects,

153
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,080
it also comes down to submitting
the right job proposals,

154
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,913
that's gonna get you the job,

155
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,183
and it's gonna lead you to
having a five star review

156
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,960
because you're not taking something

157
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,110
that you're not qualified for

158
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,420
and you don't feel comfortable
doing in the first place.

159
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,870
Step number two, check the skill level,

160
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,520
are you using appropriate filters

161
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,270
when searching for jobs and projects.

162
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,620
You need to be using
advanced filters and searches

163
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,230
when you're looking for Upwork jobs,

164
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,560
so that you're searching
for the right skill levels.

165
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,550
So before you submit a job proposal,

166
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,240
look at the desired skill level

167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,970
that the client listed on the job.

168
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,270
If your skill level is
entry level or intermediate,

169
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,340
and you're looking at expert level jobs,

170
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,773
you may want to pay
close attention to that,

171
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:35,170
because you may not
have the desired skills.

172
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,100
In my personal journey as a freelancer,

173
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,340
when I first started, I had my skill set,

174
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,920
set to intermediate level.

175
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,690
I mainly did this because I
was brand new to freelancing.

176
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,370
I wanted to prove to myself
that I could be a freelancer,

177
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,620
and I wanted to be able to take on jobs

178
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,160
that I knew I could do well on

179
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,330
where the expectations
weren't set too high

180
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,180
at expert level, when I didn't
have any jobs completed yet.

181
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's take a quick look at my
job history and my profile,

182
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,690
and I'll show you a couple of these jobs

183
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,380
that were intermediate level
that I started out on first,

184
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,180
and I ended up getting five star reviews,

185
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,630
because I delivered on them.

186
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,890
So here we are in my profile,

187
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,160
and I'll give you one quick tip

188
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,490
before we go take a look
at a couple of jobs.

189
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,860
So as you can see, my job success
score is currently at 99%.

190
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,030
Now the reason for this,

191
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,570
is because I have 30 jobs in progress.

192
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,420
I need to go through these jobs,

193
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,310
close out the ones that
aren't active anymore,

194
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,010
and just tell my clients that
if they have more work to me,

195
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,530
then they can just open up a new project

196
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,350
because they're always fine doing that.

197
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,530
So there are several things

198
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,130
that factor in your job success score.

199
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,030
You can highlight over it,
and if you click this link,

200
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,240
it'll give you descriptions
of each of these.

201
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,130
One of them is jobs in
progress that are inactive.

202
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,330
That factors into your job success score,

203
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,120
so mine basically consistently
goes back and forth

204
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,880
between 99% and 100%,

205
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,190
and it's always due to
my jobs in progress.

206
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,610
So every one of your
reviews could be five stars,

207
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,340
and pretty much all of mine are.

208
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,710
I have a couple that are like 4.8,

209
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,410
but basically you can have all
five star reviews like these,

210
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,500
but your job success
score will continuously

211
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,480
bounce between 98% and 100%,

212
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,910
because of how many inactive
jobs that you have open.

213
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,170
So you can join me and start going through

214
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,260
all your inactive jobs and
trying to get reviews for those.

215
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,420
But anyway, let's scroll
down and take a look

216
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,360
at a couple specific jobs.

217
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,470
Okay, so these first few jobs
were definitely expert level,

218
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,940
and you can tell that based on the money

219
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,240
that I made on them and the hourly rates.

220
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,660
But if we take a look at the next one,

221
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,560
we can see that this
one was for $27 an hour,

222
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,220
ended up making almost two
grand on it which is great,

223
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,900
and if we take a look at the date started,

224
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,590
we can see that I started
this job in August of 2016.

225
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,040
So I began my career on
Upwork as a freelancer

226
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,830
in May of 2016, so this was very early

227
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,540
in my freelance journey.

228
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,160
So we click on this job,

229
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,560
the first and most
important thing on this job

230
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,280
is that I got five stars on everything.

231
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
I got great feedback.

232
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,160
Let me tell you one thing,
if clients believe in you,

233
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,620
they trust you, you have great reviews,

234
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,880
the money will come.

235
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,130
Focus more on the reviews you're getting,

236
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,820
the trust you're gaining in your clients,

237
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,200
and all the money that
you want will come to you.

238
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
So in this job, I fully read the title,

239
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,070
fully went through the job description,

240
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,120
and then I checked the
skill level as well,

241
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,790
to make sure that time,
it was either entry level,

242
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,960
or intermediate, which is
what I was focusing on.

243
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,920
Then to show you one more job.

244
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,740
This was the first job that I ever had

245
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,270
on Upwork as a freelancer.

246
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,300
You can see that it was for $25 an hour,

247
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,150
ended up making $1,000 on it,

248
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,590
and it started in June of 2016,

249
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,820
right after I created my account.

250
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,160
Most importantly, again,
focus on this review

251
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,460
and focus on this feedback that I got.

252
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,600
This is so important when
you first start freelancing,

253
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,919
you need these.

254
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,799
If we click on this job,

255
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,069
again, fully went through the job title,

256
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,480
fully went through the description,

257
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,150
and we get down to the skill level

258
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,400
again entry level, intermediate,

259
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
that's what I was focusing on.

260
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,670
So make sure that you're
filtering and searching

261
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,050
for the right skill levels,

262
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,520
and if you don't know how to do this,

263
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,700
check out the card at the
very top of the screen.

264
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,070
I'm gonna link a video in

265
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,330
where I go through and explain
how to use Upwork search

266
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,980
and rank higher in search,
and within that video,

267
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,210
I go through and do filtered searches.

268
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,870
Step number three, check the
date and the time posted.

269
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,640
Before you submit a job proposal,

270
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,700
you need to check the date and time

271
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,580
that the job was posted on Upwork.

272
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,210
To give you a personal example,

273
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,740
when I first started on Upwork,

274
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,233
I didn't pay enough attention
to the day and time created.

275
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,380
What ended up happening as a result,

276
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,870
is that I submitted proposals

277
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,520
on jobs that clients
were no longer active on

278
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,320
and they had been posted a long time ago.

279
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,110
I just looked at the
title and description,

280
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,810
and decided it met my skill set,

281
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,390
and what I wanted to do on Upwork.

282
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,480
I submitted proposals, but the clients

283
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,140
weren't even looking
at those jobs anymore,

284
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,920
because they were created so long ago.

285
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
So let's go ahead and look
at a real live example.

286
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,260
I'm gonna show you an
example on Upwork right now,

287
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,360
of a job that was posted a long time ago,

288
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,190
that the client is not active on.

289
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,490
Okay, so here we are looking
for new jobs, scrolling down.

290
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,640
Oh wow, ongoing remote
position Sequel Server DBA

291
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,030
20 to 40 hours a week.

292
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,240
Wow, that looks amazing, a lot of work,

293
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,510
and this client's also
spent over $300,000.

294
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,070
I'm gonna go ahead and bid on this one.

295
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,840
So we can see that I did
submit a proposal here,

296
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,320
but just ignore that and
pretend that I didn't.

297
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,750
So we're scrolling down,

298
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,000
this job's still active by the way,

299
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,790
which is why I'm showing this to you.

300
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,370
So for the title, check,

301
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,130
definitely something I have
a ton of experience in.

302
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,370
But look at what we have
right under the title

303
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,120
posted seven months ago.

304
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,960
So I don't know about you,
but if a client posted a job

305
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,570
seven months ago, I'm gonna
assume that they're probably

306
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,490
not looking to fill this anymore.

307
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,040
But how can we verify this.

308
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,210
Maybe this job's just
been open for a long time,

309
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,950
but they're still actually
trying to find a good fit.

310
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,980
So here's what we can do.

311
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,510
We're gonna scroll down,
and boom, here we go,

312
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,780
activity on this job, second line down,

313
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,380
last viewed by client 17 days ago,

314
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,960
so they definitely viewed this job

315
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,920
within the past seven months,
from when it was posted.

316
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,530
However, they haven't even
looked at this in over two weeks.

317
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,860
Your odds of actually getting
this job, are pretty low,

318
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,350
and honestly, the odds of
them actually hiring someone

319
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,290
at this point for a job that's
been open for seven months,

320
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,370
and they've only looked at it
once in the past two weeks.

321
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,220
This is not worth the risk
of losing connects over,

322
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,307
trying to get this job.

323
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,190
The job's has been open way too long,

324
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,250
so be sure to check when
the job was actually posted,

325
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,280
and the last time that the
client viewed the job as well.

326
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,760
In the example that we looked at,

327
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,490
the client hadn't even looked at their job

328
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,910
in over two weeks.

329
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,000
That is a big red flag for me.

330
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,170
I'm not gonna put forth six connects,

331
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,680
up to six connects, trying
to beat on this job,

332
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
when they're not even looking at it.

333
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
Step number four, check the
number of proposals submitted.

334
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,650
When an Upwork job is fairly new,

335
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,730
and there's a low level of
proposals submitted for the job,

336
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,060
you have the best chance for
your proposal to get noticed.

337
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,740
Typically, I find it
best to submit proposals,

338
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,840
when there's only been
five to 10 submitted.

339
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
That's when you're gonna
have the best chance,

340
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,810
and again, this ties into why I think

341
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,750
the recent policy on Upwork
connects is a good idea,

342
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,840
the new policy is going to limit

343
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,620
the amount of spam submitting,

344
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,240
people submitting proposals
that they shouldn't be on jobs,

345
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,250
it's gonna decrease
the number of proposals

346
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,960
that are submitted for a given job,

347
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,070
giving you a better chance to get noticed

348
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,560
on the jobs that matter to you.

349
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,450
Again, a personal experience example,

350
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,080
I have an Upwork employer account.

351
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,150
I've hired freelancers to
help me with my business

352
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,490
and scaling things up.

353
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,130
So, when I created my job,

354
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,650
I started to get a bunch of
proposals pretty early on.

355
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,860
I had an short list, a few freelancers,

356
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,400
that I was really interested in.

357
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,110
So after about three or four days,

358
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,140
I had 20 to 50 proposals
submitted on the job

359
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,580
that I posted. Now, from
personal experience,

360
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,800
that was overwhelming.

361
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,150
I didn't want to take the time

362
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,710
to go through 20 to 50 proposals

363
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,133
to see if there was someone
better than the few freelancers

364
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,550
I already had shortlisted.

365
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,400
That alone is why this
step is very important.

366
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,390
You need to make sure that
you're applying for the jobs

367
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,080
that best fit your skills, fast

368
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,770
so you're gonna be
noticed by the freelancers

369
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,320
and get shortlisted
before all those build up,

370
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,960
but when you come across jobs

371
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,520
that look really intriguing to you,

372
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,740
they meet all your skills,

373
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,150
they meet all the check marks.

374
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,410
You take a look at that job,

375
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,860
there's 50 plus proposals
submitted on that job,

376
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,480
you need to take a hard look at it

377
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,250
and see if it's worth risking
your connects over that,

378
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,670
because especially if
you're a new freelancer,

379
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,240
and you get thrown into the
mix with 50 plus proposals,

380
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,890
your chance of being
noticed in all that mix

381
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,340
is going to be very low.

382
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,850
So for all the new freelancer,

383
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,120
I'll show you again what I mean here.

384
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
Here we are scrolling
down looking at jobs,

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,740
50 plus proposals, 50 plus proposals,

386
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,550
50 plus proposals, your chance
of actually being noticed

387
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,540
in that big group of proposals,

388
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,910
especially if you're a new
Freelancer, is extremely low.

389
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,990
I'm saying this to help you
not waste your connects.

390
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,420
I did this personally.

391
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,180
Trust me, you're gonna be wasting them

392
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,720
if you're bidding on jobs
that have 50 plus proposals.

393
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,030
That's so many proposals,
and yours getting thrown

394
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,340
into that huge mix of proposals,

395
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,360
there's just a low chance of you actually

396
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,390
getting that job,

397
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,580
and I'm saying this to
help you save connects,

398
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,840
so you can use those connects on jobs,

399
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,180
or you have a great chance
of getting hired and winning.

400
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,300
Step number five, check the number

401
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,180
of freelancers being interviewed.

402
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,900
Before submitting a proposal
it's also really important

403
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,890
to check the number of freelancers,

404
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,090
that are being interviewed,

405
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,710
and being considered by the client.

406
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,010
That means, if the client

407
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,130
is already interviewing some freelancers

408
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,560
who they shortlisted for
their job and favorited.

409
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,910
If they're already
interviewing these freelancers,

410
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,200
if you submit a proposal,

411
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,500
it has a less chance of being noticed,

412
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,440
and you getting an interview as well,

413
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,040
because they've already
narrowed their list down.

414
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,810
They've already found a few freelancers

415
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,200
who they're really
interested in and odds are,

416
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,940
they're gonna end up hiring one of those.

417
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,370
So again, let's quickly look at an example

418
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,520
of what I'm talking about.

419
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,010
So here we are in our list of jobs,

420
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,650
we're gonna scroll down,
and we'll click on this one.

421
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,250
Take a look at all the job details,

422
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,730
we're going down further.

423
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,410
Here we are, activity on
this job, interviewing five,

424
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,270
so they're already
interviewing five freelancers.

425
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,110
They also sent out eight invites,

426
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,770
they're probably
interviewing most of the ones

427
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,720
that they actually invited to the job,

428
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,800
so if you take a look at
the activity on a job,

429
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,570
there's a ton of proposals submitted,

430
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,270
they're interviewing freelancers already.

431
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,630
They invited a bunch,

432
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,610
your odds of actually getting an interview

433
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,720
and winning this job are pretty low.

434
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
Let me just show you something.

435
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760
Is that worth losing six connects over?

436
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,330
Bidding on a job that already
has that many proposals,

437
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,950
that many people being interviewed,

438
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,140
are you willing to lose
six connects at a chance,

439
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,000
that's very, very, very low

440
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,610
of you getting an interview as well.

441
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,750
Step number six, check
the number of connects

442
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,640
required to submit a proposal.

443
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,090
Now this step, obviously,
is one of the main steps

444
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,470
and what a lot of this
video is geared around.

445
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,880
Now when you submit a proposal on Upwork,

446
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,000
you're gonna have to use
between one and six connects

447
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,040
unless the client invited
you to bid on their job.

448
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,970
If you receive an invite from a client

449
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,760
to submit a proposal, that
doesn't take any connects.

450
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,770
That's the way it was before.

451
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,150
That's the way it is now, you
don't have to use connects

452
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,800
if you're invited, but
for all the other jobs,

453
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,100
if you're going to spin a proposal,

454
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,300
you're gonna have to use
between one and six connects.

455
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,450
So on Step five, when
we looked at the example

456
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,470
I showed you at the top

457
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,490
where it showed the amount of
connects that were required.

458
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,130
For that specific job,
it required six connects.

459
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,740
So when you're going
through your checklist,

460
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,920
you're checking off everything,

461
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,320
you get to the connects,
if it takes six connects,

462
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,950
but everything's checking
off, go ahead and bid on it.

463
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,130
So when you're looking at a job,

464
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,520
and let's just say for instance,

465
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,030
this one takes six connects.

466
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,260
You're looking at the job,
things are checking off,

467
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,100
you get to a point where a couple things

468
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,570
aren't really checking off that well,

469
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,590
or you're really unsure if
it's gonna fit your skills,

470
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,400
and you're gonna have a
great chance of being noticed

471
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,880
by the client, if it's
gonna take six connects,

472
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,350
you might want to reconsider

473
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,220
if you should bid on that job or not.

474
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,340
I say that because a new job
that better fits your skills,

475
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,820
better checks off on everything
could get posted right now,

476
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,020
even as we're talking,

477
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,370
and you would have a better chance

478
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,740
of being noticed by the client,

479
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,330
getting an interview,
and ultimately winning.

480
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,180
Step number seven, check client reviews,

481
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,690
just like Upwork, clients
are gonna go to your profile,

482
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,780
they're gonna look at your reviews

483
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,160
and your feedback.

484
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,950
You need to do the same for the client,

485
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,240
meaning that you need to be
looking at their reviews,

486
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,660
and the feedback that freelancers
are leaving the client,

487
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,310
whose job you're interested in.

488
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,900
Obviously for new Upwork clients,

489
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,420
you won't be able to do this one.

490
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,190
However, for pre-existing clients

491
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,950
who've already been on Upwork for a while,

492
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,540
already worked with a lot of freelancers,

493
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,270
they're gonna have reviews
and feedback from freelancers.

494
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,819
I've personally worked with
over 88 different clients

495
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,619
on Upwork, almost all of them

496
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,519
have been amazing clients to work with.

497
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,700
However, there have been a
few very difficult clients

498
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,790
that I've worked with, and
you can ask any Freelancer

499
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,730
who's been on Upwork for a long time,

500
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,970
I guarantee you they worked

501
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,950
with a few clients that
were really difficult.

502
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,920
So to prevent putting yourself
in this type of situation,

503
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,570
what you can do is you can
look at the client's reviews,

504
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,390
go through those, see what freelancers

505
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,610
are saying about them,
about their communication,

506
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,600
about their professionalism,
go look at those reviews,

507
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,550
and again, let's take
a look at an example.

508
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,570
Okay, so let's look at a specific example

509
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,800
scrolling down, we're
gonna click on this job,

510
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,740
SRSS and Power BI Developer.

511
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,910
Taking a look at the right
hand side of the job,

512
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,470
we can see that this client has 22 reviews

513
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,440
and 4.98 average stars which is very good.

514
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,360
So let's scroll down and take
a look at some specifics.

515
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,010
Okay, so here's the client history,

516
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,340
let's look at what freelancers
are saying, awesome client,

517
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,210
great to work with, prompt communication,

518
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,730
clear in explaining requirements,
wonderful experience,

519
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,400
wonderful experience, five
stars, wonderful experience.

520
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,970
Again, tons of five stars.

521
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,870
Awesome client, always available,
great working with them.

522
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,100
A couple of bad ones,

523
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,090
but you can see they also left
the freelancer bad reviews.

524
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,210
So here's a great example of
when you probably want to look

525
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,780
at more than one review.

526
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,250
Three stars or less like this one

527
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,330
is definitely a bad review,

528
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,490
but we can also see that
they left the freelancer

529
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,190
a pretty low review.

530
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,210
If you take a look at
all their other jobs,

531
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,880
and they have all these five stars,

532
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,020
great reviews from freelancers.

533
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,560
Then odds are, the reason
why this Freelancer

534
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,890
gave them a bad review, was
because they didn't deliver,

535
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,380
and they knew that they were
gonna receive a poor review.

536
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,600
So that's something you might
want to look at as well,

537
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,680
but taking a look at
all the other reviews,

538
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,210
amazing work ethics, clear communication.

539
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,720
There's so many great
reviews about this client,

540
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
they would be a great one
to work with, in my opinion.

541
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
So just like Upwork clients are gonna be

542
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,360
looking at your profile to
see what other Upwork clients

543
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,720
are saying about you, and what
feedback they're giving you,

544
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,550
you need to be looking at the same thing

545
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,840
on the Upwork clients jobs as well.

546
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,880
You definitely want to be

547
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,900
in a great working relationship
with Upwork clients.

548
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,840
I have some of the same
clients that I've had

549
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,440
since I started on Upwork.

550
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,580
I have a lot of long term work from them.

551
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,050
Those are the type of jobs that you want,

552
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,310
they're gonna make you a lot of money,

553
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,290
you're gonna have a lot
of trust in each other.

554
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,140
So make sure you're looking at the reviews

555
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,910
of the Upwork clients to make sure

556
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,260
you're setting yourself
up to work with someone

557
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,490
that's gonna be great,
and someone long term.

558
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,840
Step number eight, check
hours per week, if hourly,

559
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,990
and also check the project length.

560
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,580
Before submitting a job proposal,

561
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,360
you need to ask yourself this question.

562
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,790
Do you have the availability

563
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,860
to accommodate the client's needs?

564
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Now a lot of jobs are gonna
say, hours to be determined.

565
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,790
However, there are a lot of clients

566
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,090
that specify a certain amount of hours,

567
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,070
such as more than 30, less than 30,

568
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,570
so you need to be able to make sure

569
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,920
that your schedule is
going to accommodate that

570
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,500
and fit that type of requirement.

571
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,230
Then also for project length,

572
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,070
make sure that your
schedule, your availability,

573
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,370
is going to accommodate
the length to the project.

574
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,580
So if a client has a project length listed

575
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,250
as one to three months,

576
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,240
you need to make sure that for
the next one to three months,

577
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,930
you're gonna be able to
work on that project,

578
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,810
and I don't mean that you
can't do anything else

579
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,980
besides work on this project

580
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,480
for the next one to three months.

581
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,430
It means that for the
next one to three months,

582
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,820
depending on the hours,
depending on the scope,

583
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,100
all the deliverables that
you have to do for the job.

584
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,480
You need to make sure that for
the next one to three months,

585
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,490
you're gonna be able to fit
those into your schedule.

586
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,830
Now let's go ahead and take a look

587
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,290
at a specific example of where
you can view these things at

588
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,160
when you're looking at Upwork jobs.

589
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,150
Okay, so let's go ahead and
take a look at a specific job.

590
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,380
So scrolling down let's click on this one.

591
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,720
So here we can see that this job

592
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,860
is estimated to have more
than 30 hours per week.

593
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,780
So at 30 hours per week,

594
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,240
can you fit that into your schedule?

595
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Do you have 30 hours a
week in your schedule

596
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
to free up for this job.

597
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,760
Then also the project
length, right beside of it,

598
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,100
more than six months.

599
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,340
So for the next six months,

600
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,410
is this a job that you
can keep working on?

601
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,010
Do you have 30 hours per
week for more than six months

602
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,520
that you can dedicate to a new job?

603
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,490
If you do great,

604
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,660
you can check this one
off on your checklist.

605
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,900
If not, then you probably
should not bid on this job

606
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,990
because you're not gonna
be able to accommodate

607
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,390
the requirements for hours
and the length as well.

608
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,210
So be sure to check both
the hour requirements

609
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,930
and the project length as well.

610
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,430
The last thing that you want to do

611
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,080
is win a job from a client,

612
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,290
start working on it,

613
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,740
not be able to fulfill
the hour requirements,

614
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,310
and the project length as well.

615
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,110
It's gonna leave a dissatisfied client.

616
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,440
It's gonna give you a bad review,

617
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,830
and that's something that you
really, really need to avoid.

618
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,300
Step number nine, check
preferred qualifications.

619
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,010
Upwork clients set
preferred qualifications

620
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,520
to limit and filter down
to the specific freelancers

621
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,370
and talent that they're
looking for to fill their job.

622
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,880
Now if you go to submit a proposal,

623
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,920
there's gonna be a red icon on
the preferred qualifications

624
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,220
if you don't meet those.

625
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,460
You need to take a look at
this, because you probably

626
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,770
shouldn't be submitting
a proposal on a job

627
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,500
that you don't meet the requirements for.

628
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,380
Upwork clients list those for a reason

629
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,250
because we're looking for specific talent,

630
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,650
specific freelancers.

631
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,310
If you don't meet those requirements,

632
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,910
and you still bid on it any way,

633
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,970
you're basically throwing
your connects away.

634
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,160
Let's take a look at a specific example

635
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,430
of what I'm talking about.

636
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,280
So again, we're gonna open up the same job

637
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,080
that we just looked at a moment ago.

638
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,210
Now scrolling down to where
the activity section is,

639
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,090
we're gonna see preferred qualifications.

640
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,000
So preferred qualifications
talent type, independent,

641
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,340
so this means that they want
an independent Freelancer

642
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,820
not an agency.

643
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,880
Job success score has to
be at least 90% or higher,

644
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,610
English level has to be
at least conversational.

645
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,700
Upwork hours, so this is how many

646
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,310
hours you've worked on Upwork.

647
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,540
They want someone that's
at least worked 500 hours.

648
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,030
Now if you don't meet these requirements,

649
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:00,400
let's say you had a job
success score of, like, 80%,

650
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,890
I would not bid on this job

651
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,810
because they're probably
not gonna give you a chance.

652
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,940
Now, for instance, let's say
that you don't have 500 hours

653
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,770
worked on Upwork, but you had somewhere

654
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,200
between 300 to 400.

655
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,300
If you met all the other
qualifications except for hours

656
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,410
but you were really close on hours,

657
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,900
then you could consider
still submitting a proposal

658
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,430
for this job because
you were really close,

659
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,990
and they may still give you a chance,

660
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,400
because you're really close
on the hour requirement,

661
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,470
and you checked off on everything else.

662
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,930
Step number 10, check the bid range.

663
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,970
Now for bid range, What I'm talking about

664
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,700
is the high, the average,
and the low rates

665
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,920
that freelancers are bidding on the job.

666
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,320
Now let's go ahead and take a look

667
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,520
at a specific example of
what I'm talking about.

668
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,430
So again, same job example,

669
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,280
we're gonna go ahead and click on it.

670
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,170
And now if we scroll down,
we can see the bid range.

671
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,940
So the high bid range on
this job is $61 an hour,

672
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,330
the average is $27.90 cents an hour,

673
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,600
and the low is $15 an hour.

674
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,900
So you can see on average
freelancers are bidding

675
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,200
around $30 an hour for this job.

676
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,020
So the next step to check in
combination with the bid range

677
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,610
is the skill level.

678
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,720
So this client is
looking for intermediate,

679
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,920
so they're looking for a
mix of experience and value.

680
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,389
So bidding $61 an hour
or higher on this job,

681
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:19,410
is probably too high and
not gonna give you a chance

682
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,140
to be considered, because it's higher

683
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,340
than the rate that they're
actually looking for.

684
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,900
So for intermediate skill level,

685
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,610
looking for experience and value,

686
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,870
they don't really have any history

687
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,150
where I can look at what
they've paid in the past

688
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,670
for similar intermediate skill level jobs.

689
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,270
Since they don't have that history,

690
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,570
what I would do is I would bid

691
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,030
somewhere between $27 an hour,

692
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,090
or maybe $25 an hour and $30 an hour.

693
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,400
If you hit that range,

694
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,860
you're probably gonna be
setting yourself up pretty well.

695
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,790
Again, this is an intermediate level job.

696
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,740
This isn't expert.

697
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,940
If this job were an expert level job,

698
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,250
you better believe I wd
be bidding a lot higher.

699
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,470
My hourly rate now is $100 an hour.

700
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,060
That's pretty much what
I do for everything

701
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,520
unless it's fixed price.

702
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,680
So, if you want higher hourly rates,

703
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,900
it obviously ties to the skill level,

704
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,510
and now for a bonus tip.

705
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,180
Once you go through the checklist,

706
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,590
you're looking at a specific job,

707
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,300
you start checking everything off,

708
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,210
everything checks off,

709
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,590
and you're ready to submit a proposal.

710
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,800
The first one to two
sentences of your proposal

711
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,200
is what the client is gonna see first.

712
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,530
So when an Upwork client
has a huge list of proposals

713
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,990
from freelancers, your
first one to two sentences

714
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,500
of your job proposal is
what they're gonna see,

715
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,230
and we're gonna take a
look at that right now.

716
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,650
I logged into my personal
Upwork client account

717
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,670
that I use, that I've
hired freelancers on,

718
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,220
we're gonna go in and
we're gonna take a look

719
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,337
at a proposal and see the first

720
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:38,040
one or two sentences of that proposal.

721
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,700
So now we're logged into
my Upwork employer account.

722
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,510
This is a job I created for
my YouTube video editing

723
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,460
when I was looking for a video editor.

724
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,410
I obviously hired Alex, who's
editing this video right now.

725
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,243
The guy was amazing.

726
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,240
I talk about him in a lot of my videos.

727
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,700
Anyway, this is his job proposal.

728
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,500
Let's go ahead and take a
look at that real quick.

729
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,670
Okay, so here's the first
one to two sentences.

730
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,100
Look at his cover letter
and his job proposal.

731
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,980
Hello, I'm a professional video editor

732
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,240
and motion graphics artist in Los Angeles,

733
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,780
and your posts jumped out at me.

734
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,460
Ideas for your channel and be yourself,

735
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,960
there's no one on earth like you.

736
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,700
So his first one to two sentences

737
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,750
were very appealing to me and
they grabbed my attention.

738
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,780
He briefly described
that he's a video editor

739
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,980
and motion graphics artist,

740
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
what I was exactly looking for,

741
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,500
also saying that my
post jumped out at him,

742
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,640
and then not only that,

743
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,390
but he offered ideas for my
channel right from the start.

744
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,390
So when you're orchestrating
your job proposal

745
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,900
and your cover letter, and
you're saying things like,

746
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,350
Hi, my name is Josh Burns.

747
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,816
I have this many years
of experience doing this,

748
00:26:34,816 --> 00:26:36,950
blah, blah, blah, blah,

749
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,900
that's probably gonna get skipped over.

750
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,700
It's not jumping out at them obviously.

751
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,530
You need to be thinking in a way

752
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,970
to get the client to take action.

753
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,910
Write your first one or two sentences

754
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,222
to get them to take action, to
jump off the webpage at them,

755
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,180
get them to take action and get them

756
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,490
to look more into you as a freelancer.

757
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,890
So before you submit a
job proposal on Upwork,

758
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,720
make sure that you're
going through the steps,

759
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,400
go to the description in this video,

760
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,420
download my checklist, go
through it each time as well.

761
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,070
Not only will the steps
help you save connects,

762
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,510
and that's very important
now with the policy change.

763
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,560
What it's also gonna
do, it's gonna help you

764
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,150
submit the right job
proposals for the right jobs.

765
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,850
It's gonna give you
the best chance to win,

766
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,720
to win jobs over other freelancers,

767
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,343
to get those long term clients

768
00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:21,140
that you're gonna make a lot of money on.

769
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,010
If you're not getting
jobs, don't look outward.

770
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,450
Don't look at Upwork and be like,

771
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,100
well I just couldn't get any jobs there.

772
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,020
it's too hard to get jobs there.

773
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,650
Don't look outward like that.

774
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,810
There's so many freelancers on Upwork,

775
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,210
who have made so much money,

776
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,230
I've personally made
over $400,000 on Upwork,

777
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,440
and I'm on pace to break
$500,000 this year.

778
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,740
There's so many other freelancers

779
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,010
who have made more than me.

780
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,040
All this stuff is public.

781
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,740
You can go search for
freelancers and view it yourself.

782
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,760
I've seen freelancers who
have made $600,000 plus,

783
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,060
a million dollars plus,

784
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,660
there's so many successful
freelancers on the Upwork.

785
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,300
So what do I do when things
aren't going well for me,

786
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,650
I look inward, what am I doing wrong?

787
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,930
What could I do better?

788
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,640
What can I change to give
myself a better chance

789
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,400
to win jobs and beat
out other freelancers?

790
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,660
You have to look inward.

791
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,370
If you keep looking outward,
you're never gonna improve.

792
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,740
You're always gonna be looking
for something that's wrong,

793
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,010
some type of excuse that
you can give yourself

794
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,750
for why you're not winning, and
why you're not getting jobs,

795
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,330
and when you're looking for excuses,

796
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,940
you're looking outward at
all the external forces,

797
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,290
you're gonna be giving half-assed effort

798
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,460
and not hitting your full potential.

799
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
I don't know about you, but I'm not okay

800
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,110
with not giving it my all,

801
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,300
with not trying to
reach my full potential.

802
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,200
I am not okay with leaving
things on the table

803
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,600
that later on in my life,
I'm gonna look back on

804
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,760
and be like, you know what,

805
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,680
I wish I would have went
a little bit harder.

806
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,670
I wish I would have grinded
a little bit harder.

807
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,690
I wish I would have taken more risk.

808
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,930
I'm not okay with that.

809
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,530
Make sure that you keep leaving comments

810
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,350
with your success stories as well.

811
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,320
I love hearing those,

812
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,930
and I want to keep hearing about those.

813
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,610
Take a look at Sylvio's right now.

814
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,440
He has been absolutely killing
it on Upwork as a freelancer.

815
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,120
He's watched my videos,
implemented my tips,

816
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,800
and now he's reaping all
the benefits from it.

817
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,950
Keep going, man and don't let up.

818
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,610
So if you're struggling to get jobs,

819
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,380
you're struggling with your job proposals,

820
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,960
you're struggling on Upwork in general

821
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,330
as a freelancer look inward.

822
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,580
What can you do?

823
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,920
What can you change?

824
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,440
Look inward at yourself,

825
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,510
that is gonna give you the best results.

826
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,260
When you start improving on
yourself, each and every day,

827
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,610
you keep making progress,
you keep getting better,

828
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,260
the results will come and
you're gonna make more money,

829
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,110
and more money, and more
money, as a freelancer,

830
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,010
and ultimately lead you
wherever you want to go.

831
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,730
Also be sure to check out
the description box's video.

832
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,270
I recently created a Patreon
account for the channel,

833
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,780
not only will it allow you
guys to support the channel,

834
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,570
and allow me to make more content,

835
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,920
and get over the one video a week

836
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,140
that I've been doing for you,

837
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,360
to get that up to two videos,

838
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,870
or even more than that as well,

839
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,480
but what it also provides you with,

840
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,340
are different rewards per tier.

841
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,690
Now these tiers include
things like poll based voting

842
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,860
on future content, so you'll
get the voice your opinion

843
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,710
on the content that I'm creating for you.

844
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,910
They also have rewards
like a monthly 10 minute

845
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,360
call with me to discuss
any freelancing questions

846
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,450
that you have, personal
development, and channel content.

847
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,620
I literally get so many DMs
about freelancing questions,

848
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,740
that I can't reply to all of them.

849
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,270
So this is a way for you guys be able

850
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,410
to support the channel,

851
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,770
and for me to answer any
questions that you have.

852
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,380
Then even higher level tiers

853
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,220
are gonna include things

854
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,200
like monthly Google Hangout sessions.

855
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,900
We're gonna have a group hangout session

856
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,540
to focus on training, and
discussion around freelancing,

857
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,183
and then channel content as well.

858
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:25,140
Then the highest level
includes a monthly one-on-one

859
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,790
Google Hangout session with me,

860
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,580
where we will cover a predefined topic,

861
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,670
we can go through your freelance
profile, your portfolio,

862
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,640
we will go over any freelancing questions

863
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,670
that you have to get
you set up for success.

864
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,380
So again, be sure to check out
the description box's video

865
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,140
for the Josh Burn's Tech Patreon.

866
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,600
Become a supporter of the channel.

867
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,480
I greatly, greatly appreciate it.

868
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,390
I love making content for you guys,

869
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,230
and I want to dedicate more
of myself to doing that.

870
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,710
I appreciate it, thank you.

871
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,700
On this end screen, I recommend
checking out these videos,

872
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,700
and be sure to hit that
round subscribe button

873
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,950
for weekly tag videos, and
hit that notification bell,

874
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,540
so you don't miss anything.

875
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,345
Thank you for watching
and until next time, yeah.
