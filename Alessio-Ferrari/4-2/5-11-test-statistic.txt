so let's introduce this other concept these other ingredients disagree that is one of the core ingredients of how hypothesis testing which is the test statistic during that process is test normally I perform my experiment and I take a sample of data and I usually compare them into a single value this single value is called test statistic okay so imagine you have collected your data and this data can be combined and give you just one single number is just a number this number is crucial because it can tell you whether you can reject the null hypothesis or not the value of the test statistic the way you compute this test statistic depends on several factors that are related basically to the experiments that you that you have to carry out and basically the way of computing this test statistic is deterministic and is given you by statisticians okay so in this case I didn't write ========
MAGIC
============ but the way of computing the Resta T stood for you at the moment is ========
MAGIC
============ so let's see here an example here I have my testers on I my blue box my test is the so called unpaired t-test this is a specific test that is suitable for my specific case as I said the choice is deterministic and you will understand which specific test to choose in the follow in the following lecture you have collected your data so time of noir physicists and time of expert for each novice an expert you input this data into your test box into your black box and this impair test which is which impair T test that basically compared the means of two independent some posts how to read this this can be read by looking at my sample  I have a sampled novice is an expert so and I have so different people so this sample are independent and I want to see whether the mean time is different so you understand why this test allows you to either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it so we will see better this terminology later on okay but imagine you have this black box so with the test that is called unpaired t-test you have your input and you produce the T value that is for example - 0 38 and this is my test statistic my value okay so a value that is produced by the test

6. probability distribution
----
now let's go to one of the crucial slide of this presentation we said at the beginning of the presentation that there is a my assumption I start off with that with the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and I want to reject the null hypothesis so I want to show basically this that this assumption is layer is likely to be false so starting from this assumption I imagined to have a population in which the null hypothesis is actually true and I imagined to repeat an experiment with the same design as mine multiple time in this population so sampling taking samples from this population in which the null hypothesis is true and every time I compute my test distich according to according to the type of test that depends on the type of experiments that have chosen so the same black box I'm using the black box and I'm producing this number by repeating this experiment several time the test statistic so the value the value that is produced by the statistical test will follow a certain distribution which one also this case the distribution is ========
MAGIC
============  is given you by statistician and in this specific case of of the test that I was considering is the student T distribution so they are paired t-test use the student T distribution is just a name for you you will you will not need to learn what is it about the idea but the idea you have to understand it so you are repeating these experiments and you count basically the time that your that your test statistics as a certain value and you based on the on this repetition of experiment you draw your distribution of values you draw your distribution of value and you have what it is shown here in the slide you have a distribution that is centered on the value that the test statistic s when the data of my experiment confirms exactly the null hypothesis my fictional experiment is of this type okay why because if in the population the null hypothesis is true and I repeat the experiment taking this taking my sample from the population in the majority of the cases the T value will be will be the one associated to the confirmation of the null hypothesis because the null hypothesis is true in this population so that's why the majority of my samples will have exactly the value exactly the value that the test statistic has when the null hypothesis is true so the central area if the null hypothesis is true if I do an experiment it is very unlikely a random experiment an experiment with a random sample in the population it is very unlikely that the test statistic will fall on the tail and this is the trick this is the idea so it is very unfrequent that a sample will fall on the right tail or on the left tail and actually this is what I I want to show with my experiment I want to show that with my experiment that the T value of my experiment will fall on the tail we will see we will see better winner with a slide later on my tester so my if my test statistic force around the tails I can reject the null hypothesis and this is my my objective this is my goal okay so my goal is I built after building this frictional distribution in which the null hypothesis is true I want to show that there is a so my experiment so that isthis is still the test statistic he would be so rare in a population in which the null hypothesis is true that probably the null hypothesis is false okay let's see little bit a little bit of remarks so our final goal is to evaluate whether a test statistic value obtained from my experiment is so rare that it justifies rejecting the null hypothesis for entire population based on our sample data of course again I remark I don't know the entire distribution of my test statistic but this can be inferred based on the statistic of the sample data and the hypothesis I wanted a so it depends actually on my experiment and there is a deterministic way for choosing the test so that's why in this context I will assume that some ========
MAGIC
============ occurs and I know that a statistic I know the experiments they I know the type of tests that I need to choose

7. critical region
-----
critical region so we said we want our test statistic value to follow on the tails this is on the tails of my distribution this is the other thing that our goal so before doing the experiment this happens everything happens before doing my experiment I set the so-called critical region the critical region are DRS that are identified by those stiva those test statistic value that are acceptable for me so the ones that belongs to the tailor so those values that allow me to reject the null hypothesis so this is the area that I want to fall to fall on this is them let's say the segments of t statistic that that i want to consider that I consider as acceptable for a successful experiment for rejecting the null hypothesis this area indicate the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when true so this area that we will we will name in a moment in the case the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when true why? 
because it's associated with a population that is assumed to in which the null hypothesis is assumed to be true ?

8. Level of significance and confidence
----
this area is called significance level and again indicates the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when this is true it is normally denoted by alpha you will see this alpha several times and it normally takes this value 0.01 0.05 0.1 these are typical values for alpha and I explained I will explain in a moment why we use this value I want to select a certain specific value instead we have another concept that is 1 minus alpha so the the opposite the opposite of alpha that is the so-called confidence level and indicates how configure want to be about the results of my test the difficult buy of courses winos minus 1 minus alpha so 0.99 0.95 etcetera alpha sets the standard for our extreme the data must be that all my experiment must be before we reject the null hypothesis this alpha we at this moment I didn't do any experiment okay I didn't I didn't compute any data from my experiment afterwards I will complete the data from my experiment I will obtain the test statistic value for my experiment and I will have another value the so called p-value that I will compare with my alpha and therefore this p-value will indicate our extreme the data are and we will see it in the next in the next slides let's see better what is the confidence level like significance level is this area in the in the in details the corresponding confidence level is in the other region is in the central region the so called the so called acceptance region let's see the values so I said before that the specific value of the specific values of significance of alpha they have a meaning and the intuitive meaning is is listed on the on the last column so the a said that the significance level indicates a risk the risk can be a different level so from catastrophic to moderate when I set alpha to 0.001 it means that the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when this is true is catastrophic this from an intuitive point of view means that I lose more than a hundred million euros that may mean large loss of life like a nuclear disaster or and also without losing lives a large loss in software engineering we always saw our most frequently used this level of significance so 0.05 that is associated with a risk level important and indicates that it there is no lives lost and there are some injuries in some cases of course when when the risk is higher you may increase your risk level to critical and choose a significance level that is more strict but in most of the cases 0.05 is is the reference this is just to give you a meaning for for this value that and let you understand that they are somewhat established by by the community you don't need to invent an alpha every time you do an experiment although you although when I described how to perform an experiment I suggest you should select that so it should select alpha because you should be aware of this of this risk level and estimations in software engineering yeah we normally use these values let's pass now to type 1 and type 2 errors this is another concept related to my alpha so my significance level there are four possible situation when I perform my experiment and when after after designing this this hypothetical series of experiments in a population which the null hypothesis is true I then prefer my experiments and I can do the different type of error the first error is the hole type one error and is the error that corresponds to the case in which the null hypothesis in the real population is actually true but I reject incorrectly so I fall in the area in their alpha area in the in the rejection area and the area in the critical region basically but in practice in the reality the null hypothesis was true and this probability is indicated by alpha or there may be another case in which the null hypothesis is false but I'm not able to reject it so I fail to reject the null hypothesis when this is false and this is normally indicated by beta so how to remember this to remember this you can revert the thing so my alternative iPod the type 1 error is in the case that my alternative hypothesis is wrong so my theory is wrong but I support it anyway while the type 2 error is is the case in which my tentative hypothesis was correct but unfortunately I rejected it I was not able to I was not able to show that the null hypothesis was was false okay we normally in practice we normally focus on minimizing type 1 errors 


so you will see most of the the information will be associated that I will give you in the next slides will be associated with alpha and because we are mostly focusing on on cases in which we we want to have a result that that for which the risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is lower okay while beta 4 for us is is a bit less relevant but we will see the relationship between between the two values at the end of the presentation
