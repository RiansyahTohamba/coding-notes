1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,909
so let's start the second part about hypothesis testing 

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,370
so now we have seen

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,360
all the principles related to concepts

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,179
such as dependent independent variable

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,320
controlled variable treatments etc and

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,750
now let's go into the tool that allows

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,670
us to to confirm or to support let's say

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,710
my theory or to identify whether the

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,630
evidence that I can gather for the

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,350
experiment is sufficient to support it

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,309
in this this is a lesson with a lot of

12
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,640
statistics so I will provide you the

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,280
information that is useful to understand

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,020
the main principle but to really

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,420
understand the things you need really

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,449
need to resort to other two other

17
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,030
resources so to use other books for

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,430
example the book that I suggested and

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,280
other other links that I will point

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,219
throughout the lecture I will use

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,890
sometimes where a few timers actually

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,340
the word magic when something needs to

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,760
be assumed so I will not explain in

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,420
depth some aspects and I will I will

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,509
give them as to you as information if

26
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,780
you are interested you can you can do

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,240
additional research by yourself

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,299
but so that it is clear I do this so

29
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,570
that it is clear that it is not that you

30
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,369
didn't understand something but it's

31
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,060
just given you as an assumption okay so

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,100
let's start with some detailed

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,000
definition of what our hypothesis is

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,890
let's read the slide a hypothesis is a

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,200
statistical testable statement derived

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,810
from a theory and in practice from a

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,840
research question so I have my theory I

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,909
write down my research question in the

39
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,579
way that I explained during the first

40
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,869
lecture and is a statistical

41
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,369
statistically testable statement we will

42
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,960
see through this lecture what this

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,239
really mean a hypothesis is a predictive

44
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,819
statement concerning the impact of some

45
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,170
independent variable on some dependent

46
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,420
we've already understood now what is an

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,250
independent viable independent bible

48
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,500
hypothesis is a predictive statement so

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,349
every time I change in some way the

50
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,230
independent variable I expect to have

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,230
some effect some predictable effect on

52
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,250
the dependent variable this is a core

53
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,550
point when we do i potter this testing

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,940
our goal is to refute the negation of

55
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,380
the theory the reason for this you will

56
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,540
understand it throughout this lecture

57
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,459
but for now let's take it as as a fact

58
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,250
okay normally whenever we do i potter

59
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,709
this testing we start from the theory

60
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,560
and the first thing that we do is

61
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,519
Express the so-called null hypothesis h0

62
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,170
this hypothesis is the negation of the

63
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,940
statements that i want to support on the

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,920
predictive statement that i want support

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,640
so simply simply the theory does not

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,340
apply this is the typical null

67
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,190
hypothesis it is expressed normally like

68
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,940
the as a statement like the one written

69
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,640
here there is no effort between the

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,200
independent variable and the dependent

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,290
variable so the the changes in the

72
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,359
independent variable do not affect the

73
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:38,359
dependent variable and these null

74
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,329
hypothesis is assumed to be true unless

75
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:44,180
there is evidence from my data from the

76
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,579
data of my experiments that allows me to

77
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,280
reject the null hypothesis and the

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,310
statistical test is actually oriented to

79
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,459
allow you to reject the null hypothesis

80
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,639
of course you have to express both the

81
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,950
null hypothesis as I explained now and

82
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,989
also there are tentative hypotheses

83
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,400
which is the thing that you want to

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,950
support the alternative hypothesis says

85
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,569
the theory predicts of course if h0 is

86
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,730
rejected so if the null hypothesis is

87
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:19,039
false there is an evidence that h1 can

88
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,798
be correct so can be supported so the

89
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:26,229
alternative hypothesis may be true

90
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,870
this is an example so let's go directly

91
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,169
to an example here I have a method M or

92
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,710
a tool T for finding bugs a method or a

93
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,979
tool doesn't doesn't change anything so

94
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,469
something that I want that I want to use

95
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:44,710
to support my strategy for finding bugs

96
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,279
and the null hypothesis is this one the

97
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,229
experience of the developer does not

98
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,719
have that the average time to find bugs

99
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,969
in this case I imagined to have two

100
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:57,849
groups so novices and Express so people

101
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,080
with different groups with different

102
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,629
experience like in the example that we

103
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,789
discussed in the previous part of the

104
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,199
lecture and this is expressed according

105
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,840
to this this is a null hypothesis is

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,580
expressed with this formula so the devil

107
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,650
each time for now this is is equal to

108
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,300
over the average time of experts so

109
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,150
there is no difference what I want to

110
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,189
show actually is that the experience of

111
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,719
the developer actually affects the

112
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,669
average time to find bugs so my

113
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,650
alternative hypothesis is the one that

114
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,449
you see in this slide so the average

115
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,539
time of the analysis is different from

116
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,219
the average time of experts in this case

117
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:38,009
we will speak about two-tailed

118
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,960
hypothesis to be tested and you will

119
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,589
understand why we use this name in the

120
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:49,110
next slide so for now just start start

121
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,490
getting some confidence with this type

122
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,560
of terminology so we are speaking about

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,229
two-tailed hypothesis here when you have

124
00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:58,930
a name and you another hypothesis that

125
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,300
is speaking about no effect okay another

126
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,580
example let's see now because in this

127
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,960
case I'm showing I'm looking at

128
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,699
differences so there may be the case

129
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,339
that the average time of novices is

130
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,649
higher than the average time of expert

131
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,110
or lower than the average time of

132
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,990
experts if I want to know something more

133
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,270
a little more so if I want to know who

134
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,699
is quicker between novices and expert

135
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,009
I need to modify my hypothesis I need to

136
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,379
formulate it in a different way the

137
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,349
experiment is exactly the same so I am I

138
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,330
to group

139
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,759
metal groups one of novices and one of

140
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,159
experts but the formulation of the null

141
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,610
hypothesis is different how is it the

142
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,979
average time to find bugs of novices is

143
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,710
less than or equal to the one of experts

144
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,770
so is expressed in this way so this is

145
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,909
what I want to reject that I want to

146
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,550
reject the fact that novices are faster

147
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,099
than experts and of course the other way

148
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,409
around for the alternative hypothesis is

149
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,240
the average time to find bugs or novices

150
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,580
is greater than the one of experts this

151
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,979
is what I want to show when you have

152
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,180
these inequalities we speak about one

153
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,060
tael hypothesis to be tested so when you

154
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,389
have the equivalence you speak about to

155
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,490
say their position here you speak about

156
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,400
one tail about this again this will be a

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,909
clearly explained later on so let's

158
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,460
introduce this other concept these other

159
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,159
ingredients disagree that is one of the

160
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:42,150
core ingredients of how hypothesis

161
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,629
testing which is the test statistic

162
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:47,490
during that process is test normally I

163
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,669
perform my experiment and I take a

164
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,520
sample of data and I usually compare

165
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,339
them into a single value this single

166
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,520
value is called test statistic okay so

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,979
imagine you have collected your data and

168
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,580
this data can be combined and give you

169
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,250
just one single number is just a number

170
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,490
this number is crucial because it can

171
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,550
tell you whether you can reject the null

172
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,659
hypothesis or not the value of the test

173
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,089
statistic the way you compute this test

174
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,909
statistic depends on several factors

175
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,979
that are related basically to the

176
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,589
experiments that you that you have to

177
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:35,279
carry out and basically the way of

178
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,880
computing this test statistic is

179
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,169
deterministic and is given you by

180
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,049
statisticians okay so in this case I

181
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,630
didn't write magic but the way of

182
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,790
computing the Resta T stood for you at

183
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,850
the moment is magic so let's see here an

184
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,050
example here I have my testers on

185
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,700
I my blue box my test is the so called

186
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,399
unpaired t-test this is a specific test

187
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,740
that is suitable for my specific case as

188
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,779
I said the choice is deterministic and

189
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,940
you will understand which specific test

190
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,120
to choose in the follow in the following

191
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,240
lecture you have collected your data so

192
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,190
time of noir physicists and time of

193
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,370
expert for each novice an expert you

194
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,640
input this data into your test box into

195
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,339
your black box and this impair test

196
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,160
which is which impair T test that

197
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,380
basically compared the means of two

198
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,779
independent some posts how to read this

199
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,410
this can be read by looking at my sample

200
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,970
I have a sampled novice is an expert so

201
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,230
and I have so different people so this

202
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,500
sample are independent and I want to see

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,470
whether the mean time is different so

204
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,339
you understand why this test allows you

205
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,890
to either reject the null hypothesis or

206
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,480
fail to reject it so we will see better

207
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,060
this terminology later on okay but

208
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,490
imagine you have this black box so with

209
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,500
the test that is called unpaired t-test

210
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,570
you have your input and you produce the

211
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,500
T value that is for example - 0 38 and

212
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,140
this is my test statistic my value okay

213
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,399
so a value that is produced by the test

214
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,640
now let's go to one of the crucial slide

215
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,579
of this presentation we said at the

216
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:30,220
beginning of the presentation that there

217
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,380
is a my assumption I start off with that

218
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,399
with the assumption that the null

219
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,910
hypothesis is true and I want to reject

220
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,399
the null hypothesis so I want to show

221
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,339
basically this that this assumption is

222
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:45,910
layer is likely to be false so starting

223
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,949
from this assumption I imagined to have

224
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,750
a population in which the null

225
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,850
hypothesis is actually true and I

226
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,339
imagined to repeat an experiment with

227
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:55,959
the same design as mine

228
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,380
multiple time in this population so

229
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,360
sampling taking samples from this

230
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,160
population in which the null hypothesis

231
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,490
is true and every time I compute my test

232
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,910
distich according to according to the

233
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,089
type of test that depends on the type of

234
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,850
experiments that have chosen so the same

235
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,830
black box I'm using the black box and

236
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,950
I'm producing this number by repeating

237
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,610
this experiment several time the test

238
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,750
statistic so the value the value that is

239
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,480
produced by the statistical test will

240
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,450
follow a certain distribution which one

241
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,880
also this case the distribution is magic

242
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,950
is given you by statistician and in this

243
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,790
specific case of of the test that I was

244
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,250
considering is the student T

245
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,440
distribution so they are paired t-test

246
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,260
use the student T distribution is just a

247
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,180
name for you you will you will not need

248
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,190
to learn what is it about the idea but

249
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,260
the idea you have to understand it so

250
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,600
you are repeating these experiments and

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,450
you count basically the time that your

252
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,450
that your test statistics as a certain

253
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,320
value and you based on the on this

254
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,529
repetition of experiment you draw your

255
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,540
distribution of values you draw your

256
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,430
distribution of value and you have what

257
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,910
it is shown here in the slide you have a

258
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,459
distribution that is centered on the

259
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,370
value that the test statistic s when the

260
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,920
data of my experiment confirms exactly

261
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,770
the null hypothesis my fictional

262
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,890
experiment is of this type okay why

263
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,829
because if in the population the null

264
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,829
hypothesis is true and I repeat the

265
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,860
experiment taking this taking my sample

266
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,350
from the population in the majority of

267
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,610
the cases the T value will be will be

268
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,300
the one associated to the confirmation

269
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,130
of the null hypothesis because the null

270
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,020
hypothesis is true in this population

271
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,740
so that's why the majority of my samples

272
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,000
will have exactly the value exactly the

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,180
value that the test statistic has when

274
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,550
the null hypothesis is true so the

275
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,730
central area if the null hypothesis is

276
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,380
true if I do an experiment it is very

277
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,360
unlikely a random experiment an

278
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,730
experiment with a random sample in the

279
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,029
population it is very unlikely that the

280
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,029
test statistic will fall on the tail and

281
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,190
this is the trick this is the idea so it

282
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,020
is very unfrequent that a sample will

283
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,420
fall on the right tail or on the left

284
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,699
tail and actually this is what I I want

285
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,680
to show with my experiment I want to

286
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,400
show that with my experiment that the T

287
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,680
value of my experiment will fall on the

288
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,810
tail we will see we will see better

289
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,890
winner with a slide later on my tester

290
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,589
so my if my test statistic force around

291
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:07,720
the tails I can reject the null

292
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,329
hypothesis and this is my my objective

293
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,120
this is my goal okay so my goal is I

294
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,250
built after building this frictional

295
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,820
distribution in which the null

296
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,890
hypothesis is true I want to show that

297
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,260
there is a so my experiment so that

298
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,070
isthis is still the test statistic he

299
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,640
would be so rare in a population in

300
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,070
which the null hypothesis is true that

301
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,579
probably the null hypothesis is false

302
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,040
okay let's see little bit a little bit

303
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,649
of remarks so our final goal is to

304
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,920
evaluate whether a test statistic value

305
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,899
obtained from my experiment is so rare

306
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,540
that it justifies rejecting the null

307
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,149
hypothesis for entire population based

308
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:55,540
on our sample data of course

309
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,140
again I remark I don't know the entire

310
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,600
distribution of my test statistic but

311
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,339
this can be inferred based on the

312
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,589
statistic of the sample data and the

313
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,990
hypothesis I wanted a so it depends

314
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,540
actually on my experiment and there is a

315
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,050
deterministic way for choosing the test

316
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,209
so that's why in this context I will

317
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:19,060
assume that some magic occurs and I know

318
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,370
that a statistic I know the experiments

319
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,860
they I know the type of tests that I

320
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,699
need to choose critical region so we

321
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:30,760
said we want our test statistic value to

322
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,420
follow on the tails

323
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,640
this is on the tails of my distribution

324
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,600
this is the other thing that our goal so

325
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,880
before doing the experiment this happens

326
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,709
everything happens before doing my

327
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,800
experiment I set the so-called critical

328
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,130
region the critical region are DRS that

329
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,149
are identified by those stiva those test

330
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:55,550
statistic value that are acceptable for

331
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,640
me so the ones that belongs to the

332
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,500
tailor so those values that allow me to

333
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,649
reject the null hypothesis so this is

334
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,620
the area that I want to fall to fall on

335
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,589
this is them let's say the segments of t

336
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,079
statistic that that i want to consider

337
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,690
that I consider as acceptable for a

338
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,269
successful experiment for rejecting the

339
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,779
null hypothesis this area indicate the

340
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,410
risk of rejecting the null hypothesis

341
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,240
when true so this area that we will we

342
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,130
will name in a moment in the case the

343
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,649
risk of rejecting the null hypothesis

344
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:38,899
when true why because it's associated

345
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,220
with a population that is assumed to in

346
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,500
which the null hypothesis is assumed to

347
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,850
be true this area is called significance

348
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,790
level and again indicates the risk of

349
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,529
rejecting the null hypothesis when this

350
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,570
is true it is normally denoted by alpha

351
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,730
you will see this alpha several times

352
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,209
and it normally takes this value 0.01

353
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,079
0.05 0.1 these are typical values for

354
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,270
alpha and I explained I will explain in

355
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,119
a moment why we use this value I want to

356
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,150
select a certain specific value instead

357
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,540
we have another concept that is 1 minus

358
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,169
alpha so the the opposite the opposite

359
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,089
of alpha that is the so-called

360
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,849
confidence level and indicates how

361
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,549
configure want to be about the results

362
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,740
of my test the difficult buy of courses

363
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:35,080
winos minus 1 minus alpha so 0.99 0.95

364
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,190
etcetera alpha sets the standard for our

365
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,370
extreme the data must be that all my

366
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,250
experiment must be before we

367
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,880
reject the null hypothesis this alpha we

368
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,220
at this moment I didn't do any

369
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,420
experiment okay I didn't I didn't

370
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,040
compute any data from my experiment

371
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,510
afterwards I will complete the data from

372
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,510
my experiment I will obtain the test

373
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,370
statistic value for my experiment and I

374
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,650
will have another value the so called

375
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,430
p-value that I will compare with my

376
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,360
alpha and therefore this p-value will

377
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,300
indicate our extreme the data are and we

378
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,790
will see it in the next in the next

379
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,500
slides

380
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,790
let's see better what is the confidence

381
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,400
level like significance level is this

382
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,130
area in the in the in details the

383
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,500
corresponding confidence level is in the

384
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,450
other region is in the central region

385
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,210
the so called the so called acceptance

386
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:44,480
region let's see the values so I said

387
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,300
before that the specific value of the

388
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,970
specific values of significance of alpha

389
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,920
they have a meaning and the intuitive

390
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,720
meaning is is listed on the on the last

391
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,800
column so the a said that the

392
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,560
significance level indicates a risk the

393
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,480
risk can be a different level so from

394
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,150
catastrophic to moderate when I set

395
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,990
alpha to 0.001 it means that the risk of

396
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,090
rejecting the null hypothesis when this

397
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,050
is true is catastrophic this from an

398
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,560
intuitive point of view means that I

399
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,950
lose more than a hundred million euros

400
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,480
that may mean large loss of life like a

401
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,390
nuclear disaster or and also without

402
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,490
losing lives a large loss in software

403
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,600
engineering we always saw our most

404
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,050
frequently used this level of

405
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,910
significance so 0.05 that is associated

406
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,830
with a risk level important and

407
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,389
indicates that it

408
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:01,519
there is no lives lost and there are

409
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,129
some injuries in some cases of course

410
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:09,399
when when the risk is higher you may

411
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:12,559
increase your risk level to critical and

412
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,899
choose a significance level that is more

413
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:19,519
strict but in most of the cases 0.05 is

414
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,099
is the reference this is just to give

415
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:24,769
you a meaning for for this value that

416
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:26,629
and let you understand that they are

417
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,690
somewhat established by by the community

418
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,489
you don't need to invent an alpha every

419
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:34,839
time you do an experiment although you

420
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,700
although when I described how to perform

421
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,979
an experiment I suggest you should

422
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,869
select that so it should select alpha

423
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:44,929
because you should be aware of this of

424
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,059
this risk level and estimations in

425
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:51,589
software engineering yeah we normally

426
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,830
use these values let's pass now to type

427
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,559
1 and type 2 errors this is another

428
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,710
concept related to my alpha so my

429
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,739
significance level there are four

430
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,769
possible situation when I perform my

431
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,599
experiment and when after after

432
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:12,589
designing this this hypothetical series

433
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,599
of experiments in a population which the

434
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,039
null hypothesis is true

435
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,289
I then prefer my experiments and I can

436
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,299
do the different type of error the first

437
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,389
error is the hole type one error and is

438
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:26,719
the error that corresponds to the case

439
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,299
in which the null hypothesis in the real

440
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:33,799
population is actually true but I reject

441
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,609
incorrectly so I fall in the area in

442
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:40,789
their alpha area in the in the rejection

443
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:43,549
area and the area in the critical region

444
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,539
basically but in practice in the reality

445
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,960
the null hypothesis was true and this

446
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,299
probability is indicated by alpha or

447
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,330
there may be another case in which the

448
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,960
null hypothesis is false but I'm not

449
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,679
able to reject it so I fail to reject

450
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,779
the null hypothesis when this is false

451
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,919
and this is normally indicated by beta

452
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,770
so how to remember this to remember this

453
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,260
you can revert the thing so my

454
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,810
alternative iPod the type 1 error is in

455
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,610
the case that my alternative hypothesis

456
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,710
is wrong so my theory is wrong but I

457
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,620
support it anyway while the type 2 error

458
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,260
is is the case in which my tentative

459
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,560
hypothesis was correct but unfortunately

460
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,890
I rejected it I was not able to I was

461
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,290
not able to show that the null

462
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,920
hypothesis was was false okay

463
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,870
we normally in practice we normally

464
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,660
focus on minimizing type 1 errors so you

465
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,900
will see most of the the information

466
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,150
will be associated that I will give you

467
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,350
in the next slides will be associated

468
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,210
with alpha and because we are mostly

469
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,700
focusing on on cases in which we we want

470
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,580
to have a result that that for which the

471
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,400
risk of incorrectly rejecting the null

472
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,350
hypothesis is lower okay

473
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,020
while beta 4 for us is is a bit less

474
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,210
relevant but we will see the

475
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,160
relationship between between the two

476
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,750
values at the end of the presentation so

477
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,580
let's go back to our test I spoke about

478
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,630
2/3 tests and one taste test this is the

479
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,420
two taste tester represented with some

480
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,370
of our example with some more

481
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,840
information so again alpha the

482
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,940
significance is the risk of rejecting

483
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,800
the null hypothesis when when true

484
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,790
the value of 0.05 in this case for

485
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,330
Convention is split between the tails so

486
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,890
one of the area is is hard for alpha

487
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,360
alpha alpha the population is the one

488
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,430
that confirms the null hypothesis so the

489
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,080
population is the one in which the other

490
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,870
time for novices is equal to the average

491
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,810
time of experts while in the two tails

492
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,690
in the so-called rejection rejection

493
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,700
region I have the alternative hypothesis

494
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,470
that the average time of knowledge is

495
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,090
different from the average time of

496
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:25,340
aspect and of course I want to fall

497
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,450
there

498
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,280
one of the areas in the case of the

499
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,680
one-tailed test the representation is

500
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,590
slightly different because in this case

501
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,720
I have another Patris that is the

502
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
average time to find box oh no this is

503
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,550
greater than or equal to the one of

504
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,320
experts so my null hypothesis is

505
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,700
represented on the right part of this

506
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,860
life so the average time of novices is

507
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,750
greater or equal than average time of

508
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,240
experts because this is my hypothetical

509
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,190
population which the null hypothesis is

510
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,130
true and I want to fall on the left tail

511
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,160
in this case as a home vention the value

512
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,190
of alpha is the entire entire area

513
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,490
entire area on the tails so 0.05 is this

514
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,560
whole area right is the the one tailed

515
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,470
test right is the opposite case okay so

516
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,540
the average time to find bugs of novices

517
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,960
is less than or equal the one of experts

518
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,630
is my null hypothesis so the one that I

519
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,790
really want to reject I want to show the

520
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:33,230
experts are our quicker are faster and I

521
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,150
want to fall in the in the right area

522
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,710
now let's pass so now we have understood

523
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,530
what water is the alpha value

524
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,280
significance value what is the one

525
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,160
tailed test and Tutte test but still we

526
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,710
didn't actually perform the real

527
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,900
experiment we didn't perform the real

528
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,120
test actually the experiment probably

529
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,160
was the experiment was already performed

530
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,970
but we didn't we just set up the test so

531
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,290
the p-value I said that a tester generic

532
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,500
the statistical test produced a test

533
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,600
statistic value at a statistic value

534
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,200
that depends on the type of tests I mean

535
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,130
in this example is the so called T value

536
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,760
each test always produce also a p-value

537
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,240
each single test in general since now

538
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,510
you have to remember that low values of

539
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:34,250
peak so low means around 0.001 are good

540
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,280
high values like higher than higher than

541
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,950
0.5 0.0 5

542
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,100
we will see our bad ok so the p-value

543
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,169
you already understand there is

544
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,360
something that needs to be compared with

545
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,480
my alpha

546
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,980
let's see graphically what is the

547
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,370
p-value we saw that alpha that was set

548
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,880
up before the experiment was is was this

549
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,440
area on the on the tail after doing my

550
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,200
experiment I can derive my test

551
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,720
statistic value that is here in the

552
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,450
x-axis and I can derive of course

553
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,990
another area the p-value is exactly this

554
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,539
blue area if this blue area is lower

555
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,389
than the alpha then the alpha area then

556
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,360
it means that my test statistic value is

557
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,059
a safe one is such that that I can

558
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,909
reject the null hypothesis because it's

559
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:32,330
so rare that I would fall here if the

560
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,639
null hypothesis was true that is more

561
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,130
likely that the null hypothesis was

562
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,179
false is false in the case of two-tailed

563
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:46,220
again as a convention we said that alpha

564
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,580
is divided by 2 in the true area and the

565
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,669
p-value resulting from from my from my

566
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:56,389
experiment it will be this blue area the

567
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,130
some of the blue area actually

568
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,380
so alpha and P are the sum of the area

569
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,559
in the two tails and alpha P are shared

570
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,960
basically between between the between

571
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,929
the two tails and mm-hmm

572
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:10,820
the test statistic value I ever derive

573
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,250
from the data falls just on one of the

574
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,950
tail you have just one one single value

575
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,190
when you when you do the test but this

576
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,720
is to let you understand how the p-value

577
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,510
works for both one tailed and two tailed

578
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,820
test and I think the graphical the

579
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,799
graphical explanation is pretty is

580
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,250
pretty clear so besides the graphical

581
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,630
explanation that I think is the most

582
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,990
intuitive way to understand the p-value

583
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,880
there are also different ways to

584
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,760
interpret it and to understand it from

585
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,159
other point of view let's read let's

586
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,799
read this three possible interpretation

587
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,289
the first one says the p-value indicates

588
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:53,299
the believability of the David

589
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,090
advocate case that the null hypothesis

590
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,210
is true given the sample data so how

591
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,340
believable is the case that null

592
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,440
hypothesis is true given my evidence I

593
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,809
want this to be as at least as least

594
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,989
believable as possible so as P as lower

595
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:16,149
as possible

596
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:20,419
the second way of explaining the p-value

597
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:22,999
is the p-value is the probability of

598
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:25,039
observing a test statistic that is at

599
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,960
least as Extreme as your test statistic

600
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,659
when you assume that the null hypothesis

601
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:32,619
is true again this is a similar way of

602
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:36,619
of interpreting the the p-value that

603
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:38,509
let's start from the idea that our null

604
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,629
hypothesis is true and I am observing a

605
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,119
test statistics that is very extreme

606
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,220
that is very uncommon in a population

607
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,960
when the null hypothesis is true when

608
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
the null hypothesis is true

609
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,239
the p-value at the third interpretation

610
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:56,119
the TV value the p-value indicates to

611
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,340
adjust and the results may be de memy

612
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,379
due to a random variation within your

613
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:02,179
data which make them different from the

614
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,609
actual population so this is another way

615
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:06,889
from another perspective if the actual

616
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,580
population is actually true the the

617
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,429
p-value may indicate that your data

618
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,059
actually full full and there because

619
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,559
they are because they are due to some

620
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,440
random variation in the data okay so the

621
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,779
T value is falling there because it's

622
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:29,960
still possible that very unlikely but

623
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,059
still possible that in a population

624
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:34,190
where the null hypothesis is true a

625
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,320
certain test would fall there okay

626
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,840
the conclusion is the people when the

627
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,450
p-value is very low the null hypothesis

628
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,679
is rejected in favor of the alternative

629
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,619
hypothesis otherwise if the p-value is

630
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:55,039
greater than alpha we say that I fail to

631
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,009
reject the meaning of very low depends

632
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:00,679
on the on the value of alpha so what I

633
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,609
search for is p-value my less or equal

634
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:07,160
than alpha and I search to fall on the

635
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,760
and I think this is clear to you I mean

636
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,330
I'm saying reject and fail to reject and

637
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,700
not accept and not accept because here

638
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,070
you have to consider that you are

639
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,920
inferring some information about an

640
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,650
entire population from a single sample

641
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,800
so if your single sample that is your

642
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,460
experiment is is different from it is

643
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,360
different from the the actual population

644
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,770
you know let's let's say it in another

645
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,990
way if you are you are comparing

646
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,800
basically a single sample with we want

647
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,620
to use the information from the simple

648
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,010
sample to you want to use the

649
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,830
information from the cincone sample to

650
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,560
infer some in conclusion some

651
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,420
information about the entire population

652
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,600
of course this cannot be something that

653
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,080
that confirms completely a certain

654
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,110
hypothesis but it can be say if if your

655
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,870
sample is so rare it can be sufficient

656
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,750
to reject the assumption so there are

657
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,370
some so that the null hypothesis is true

658
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,160
so that's why we are using this

659
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,130
terminology of rejecting and fail to

660
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,590
reject and not accept because it is

661
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:37,130
likely that your hypothesis is true but

662
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,940
to actually show that your hypothesis is

663
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,340
true you would need to repeat the

664
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,250
experiment many more times and show that

665
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,060
the actual distribution follow the one

666
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,490
order of the test that is to follow the

667
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:57,020
one of of the of your alternative

668
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,740
hypothesis last thing is the effect size

669
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,120
the effect size is another number that

670
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,280
is producing is produced throughout a

671
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,130
test not directly but a test but through

672
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,640
another to another computation this is

673
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,710
useful because something that is

674
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,790
statistically significant when

675
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,580
is less than or equal than alpha we say

676
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
that the results are statistically

677
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,990
significant but this does not imply that

678
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,740
there is a large effect and the effect

679
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,440
size measures how large is this effect

680
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,660
how big is this effect so how much is

681
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,190
the difference for example between

682
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,890
novices and experts to compute the the

683
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,170
effect size as I stick the data from my

684
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,150
experiment and I use a specific

685
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,610
approaches for computing the effect size

686
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,880
that in this case will be equal to 2 so

687
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,770
another number that is produced by the

688
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,160
test and that I need to interpret there

689
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,440
are several ways of computing this

690
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,900
effect size here I will give you some

691
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,010
point ok so FX size is a quantitative

692
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,050
measure of the magnitude of the

693
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,020
treatment so how much better is my tool

694
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,070
how much faster are the are the expert I

695
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,130
will faster at the aspect and the effect

696
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,190
size measure either the size of

697
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,989
association and relationship between

698
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,840
variable for example if I have a

699
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,090
question research question like the one

700
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,480
that is shown here like how much is

701
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,399
experience correlated with development

702
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:39,770
speeds so this is a relationship an

703
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,980
association or the size of the

704
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,860
differences between group means how much

705
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,710
is the difference between Thule MB this

706
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,219
is more related to to our example there

707
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,560
are several ways to measure the effect

708
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,310
size and but here I exemplify just to

709
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,880
because it's just a matter of of

710
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,300
computation Cohen's D is used for

711
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,880
differences Pearson R correlation is

712
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,870
used for relationship but it can depend

713
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,140
also on the type of data categorical or

714
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,270
numeric and on the type of sample if

715
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,970
they are paired or unpaired you can find

716
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:24,500
the specific effect size measure to use

717
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,250
in Wikipedia so take in your case your

718
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,910
example your your experimental case you

719
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,839
can select

720
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,999
in a deterministic way which is the

721
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,859
effect size that you should use like for

722
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:39,049
the test and but for the tester we

723
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,180
explain you better next in the next

724
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:46,160
lecture Cohen's D quantity indicates

725
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,819
that the difference between the means

726
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:51,589
device is the difference between the

727
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:53,029
means divided by the standard deviation

728
00:35:53,029 --> 00:35:55,430
of the population from which the data

729
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,049
were sampled you don't need to

730
00:35:57,049 --> 00:36:01,400
understand this in depth basically the

731
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,049
watch what you need to remember is that

732
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:07,609
quantity of one in the case that the two

733
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:11,529
group differ by 1 star the division the

734
00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:13,670
quantity of 2 indicates that they differ

735
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,769
by 2 standard deviation and so on and

736
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:18,559
this is how you should interpret them

737
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,190
according to this table so this is 0.01

738
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,559
indicates that effect size is very small

739
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,739
D equals 2 to 2 indicates that the

740
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:29,739
effect size is very large

741
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:33,460
similarly for Pearson R that indicates

742
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,049
differently from Cohen's D indicates the

743
00:36:36,049 --> 00:36:38,630
correlation between variable so for

744
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,789
example number of bugs in relationship

745
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:42,499
with the length of the of the code

746
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:47,269
sample here I have I have the value that

747
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:50,809
is between minus 1 and 1 the effect size

748
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,680
is low if Pearson R is around 0.1 media

749
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,769
medium if it's around 0.3 and large if

750
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:00,349
it's more than 0.5 so every time you do

751
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:02,420
an experiment you say okay my results

752
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,549
are significant and the effect size is

753
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:06,950
low medium or large of course you are

754
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,539
searching for large effect size so in

755
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:13,489
all our evaluations we have assumed that

756
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:15,529
the population was confirming the null

757
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:18,979
hypothesis and so we aimed at avoiding

758
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:22,789
type 1 error so rejecting the null

759
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:26,829
hypothesis when it was when it was true

760
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,200
but there is still a possibility that we

761
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,450
make it up to error so fail to reject

762
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,180
the null hypothesis when the actual

763
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,900
population rejects it so I fall closer

764
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,089
to the center of my of my of my

765
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:46,760
distribution but the actual population a

766
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,790
is actually in favor of the alternative

767
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,619
hypothesis in this case is to control

768
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,840
for this cases which established a value

769
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,180
that is normally called beta and is the

770
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,100
probability of accepting the null

771
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,130
hypothesis although it is false and is

772
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,020
associated beta as we saw at the

773
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,900
beginning which are two error if the

774
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,330
null hypothesis is false this real

775
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,060
this means that Maria population follows

776
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,460
the alternative hypothesis but I'm not

777
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,070
able to show that from my from my data

778
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,440
let's see how these are depicted

779
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,270
depicted in this in this diagram so we

780
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:30,560
had our distribution if our h0 our null

781
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,930
hypothesis would be true and we have the

782
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,090
other distribution still for the test

783
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,990
statistic that we would have if the

784
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,090
alternative hypothesis would be true

785
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,460
this would be positioned in different

786
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,960
part of my of my diamond different part

787
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,460
of my x axis okay

788
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:57,410
our alpha is the value associated to the

789
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,210
first distribution so the distribution

790
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,859
of the null hypothesis to ever-smaller

791
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:07,400
alpha i have somehow to push this bar

792
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,700
towards the right to reduce there or my

793
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,950
alpha the issue is that if I reduce

794
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,340
alpha I tend to increase the other value

795
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,190
beta beta which is the probability of

796
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,250
accepting the null hypothesis when this

797
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,070
is false and remember the Alpha is the

798
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,990
probability of rejecting the null

799
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,440
hypothesis when this is true so every

800
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,700
time I try to decrease alpha my test

801
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,810
statistic may fall in the may fall on

802
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,480
the on the left part of this of the

803
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,750
central bar and this may be also

804
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,109
associated by the case in which the

805
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:53,660
distribution h1 was representing the

806
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,300
actual population but I am not able to

807
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,310
reject the null hypothesis because if I

808
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,620
fall here in this red area

809
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,960
I don't reject I am not able to reject

810
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,990
the null hypothesis so they they trade

811
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,870
off the trade or a trade off must be

812
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,600
chosen normally we are oriented to

813
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,540
choose a smaller alpha also with the

814
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,370
risk of of not being on failing to

815
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,160
reject a null hypothesis in general this

816
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,340
is what is commonly done but the problem

817
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,420
is that whenever we try to minimize type

818
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,780
1 errors so reducing my alpha we end up

819
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,880
increasing the chance of type 2 errors

820
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,000
there's no there's no way that that you

821
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,340
can that you can balance in our case we

822
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,780
must look at rejecting the null

823
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,090
hypothesis so we focus on type 1 error

824
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,520
but I guess that from this diagram you

825
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,520
have understood what is the difference

826
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,280
between the two errors and what is the

827
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,610
trade-off consider that this line is the

828
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,400
line that comes out after you have

829
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,410
selected your alpha okay it's not really

830
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,260
a selection of a specific line is a

831
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,140
byproduct of the selection of the alpha

832
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,300
value so I choose the alpha value and I

833
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,520
have a line in a certain position and as

834
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,700
a consequence I will avoid so beta in

835
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,790
another in the India on the opposite

836
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,820
side finally at this point I think you

837
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,340
have understood why we look at rejecting

838
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,180
the null and not at let's say accepting

839
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,170
accepting the alternative the main

840
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,480
reason is that we are always thinking

841
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,570
about distribution but our experiment is

842
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:39,070
just one sample and this sample is used

843
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:43,640
to reason on an entire population so I

844
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,850
can reject a hypothesis or fail to

845
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,760
reject it but never accept it because

846
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,880
it's just one single sample if I would

847
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,350
like to accept the alternative

848
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:58,370
hypothesis this would imply that I need

849
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,200
to repeat the experiment many more times

850
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,420
and with different sample taken from the

851
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,850
actual population and show that my test

852
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,620
statistic follows exactly the

853
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,510
distribution of the alternative

854
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,090
hypothesis and this is very hard because

855
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,740
I have to repeat the experiment several

856
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,480
times so it's easier to show

857
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,260
that my experiment shows a t-value a

858
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,750
test statistic value that is so rare in

859
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,150
a population where the null hypothesis

860
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,520
is is true that is more likely that the

861
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,880
null hypothesis is incorrect is is false

862
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,440
so I can reject it but I'm never sure of

863
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,100
course

864
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,560
to be sure I would need to repeat my

865
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,109
experiments in a population many many

866
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:46,160
more times I think that this makes you

867
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,760
understand why we speak about this three

868
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,950
key thing of rejecting the null

869
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,490
hypothesis we and the all statistical

870
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,590
test is is based on rejecting the null

871
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,740
hypothesis is another more of such an

872
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,320
intuitive way to understand it is the

873
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,109
one that I've put here that is let's say

874
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:08,000
that it is easier to disprove that all

875
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,609
swans are white because I I need only to

876
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:12,770
find one black swan than to prove it

877
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,380
because in this case I need to check all

878
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,650
possible Swan and there is always a

879
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:21,830
chance I can hypothesize the chance that

880
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,270
there will be one one black black one

881
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,960
but less one in in my population okay

882
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,220
this is a the additional intuition too

883
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,040
to make you understand why with the one

884
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,400
sample I cannot I cannot say I accept a

885
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,350
certain a certain hypothesis a certain

886
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,090
eternity by politics okay

887
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,850
summary of key concept that you need to

888
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,340
remember whenever you perform an

889
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,020
experiment keep in mind this four

890
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,420
concept level of significance this is

891
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,850
alpha and tells me how much risk I can

892
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,470
take and every time in software

893
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,850
engineering is 0.055 and if he said at

894
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,760
the beginning of the experiment then he

895
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,000
said as a value before starting your

896
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,859
experiment based on the risk that you

897
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,880
are willing to take test statistic this

898
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,740
is the value that depends on the test

899
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,570
that you make and it serves to

900
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:23,150
understand how much my sample is rare in

901
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:24,770
a population in which the null

902
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,850
hypothesis is true

903
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,310
okay is the output of

904
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,650
your computation is the output of your

905
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,080
test and these produce based on your

906
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,570
experimental data this number alone

907
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,100
doesn't say much we will see some

908
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,410
example of T values that do not tell do

909
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,170
not tell us much what is important to

910
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,510
consider instead is another product of

911
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:48,920
the statistical test that is the p value

912
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,740
the p value indicates the probability of

913
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,590
rejecting the null hypothesis when it is

914
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,890
actually true it is produced - based on

915
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,500
my experimental data and it needs to be

916
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,140
compared with alpha if it is lower than

917
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,510
alpha then I am happy because it means

918
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,610
that I am able to reject the null

919
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,760
hypothesis in favor of the alternative

920
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,550
hypothesis finally the effect sides the

921
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,650
effect size indicates how large is the

922
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,300
difference between the two treatments or

923
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,100
how much is the correlation between the

924
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,130
independent and dependent variable so

925
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,600
differences or correlation and we said

926
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,420
it depends of the chosen test and there

927
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,930
are tables to assess how large is this

928
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,380
effect size here you have a graphical

929
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,970
summary and that I think is quite

930
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,460
intuitive you start from the data of

931
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,250
your experiment you select a

932
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,010
significance level you perform your test

933
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,680
this test will produce a test statistic

934
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,500
and as a by-product a p-value at this

935
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,630
point you compare with the p-value with

936
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,240
the significance value and if it's lower

937
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,640
or while you reject the null hypothesis

938
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,920
at the same time you have to perform the

939
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,170
effect size computation by taking the

940
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:06,530
data of your experiment and compute the

941
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,630
effect size and compare it with the

942
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,030
typical value of effect size and decide

943
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,850
whether your effect is small or large

944
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:20,050
and this it is easy
