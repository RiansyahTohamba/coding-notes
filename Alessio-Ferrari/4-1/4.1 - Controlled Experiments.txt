CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT

oh hello to everyone 
today we we start with a some more hi some harder material with respect to the other lectures which were giving an overview of empirical studies in software engineering now we start with with one of the strategies that that we listed last time and these controlled experiments here I put a couple of references that you can take for to extend some to extend the material that you will find we will find in these slides we will go through through this topic in this lecture and in a key in the next in the next lecture 
-----
in which i will show you guidelines on how to select to select empirical tests for controlled experiments so last time to take take a bit from last lecture we will show the different types of research strategies and 
we saw that experiments laboratory experiments controlled experiments in vitro experiment as a paradigm are typically strategies that require are contrived settings so an artificial settings okay? 
==============
Experiment dilakukan di lab, actually SW ENG Lab dapat hanya berupa only room. Pada ruangan tersebut kita bisa eliminasi confounding factors.
==============
not the natural one a setting in which I am for example in the lab, of course ! 
(lab) for software engineering experiment it doesn't necessarily need to be like a scientific lab but at least room or a space in which you can you can eliminate some "confounding factors" or some "confounding variables" as as we will see in the next slide. 
So the goal when do you use a controlled experiment when your goal is to measure the behavior in a precise way the behavior of whom may be very behavior of actors actors can be as we as we said last time both software engineers but also tools okay precision is the core and it is also important to highlight that these behavior needs to be related to quite clearly identifiable variables.

FIELD STUDY VS Experiment

So if the variables that you want to measure are too complex and are affected by several factors in practice. 
it is very unlikely that you will use an experiment. 
it's more appropriate to use a field study okay when you can isolate your variable and we will see some examples it is appropriate to use an experiment as a research strategy okay control that we speak about controlled experiments but you will find also synonyms in the literature so laboratory experiments but also simply experiment. 
------------
TERMINOLOGI : laboratory experiments == controlled experiments
------------------
okay but they refer mostly to the same thing we will discuss next time a little bit about the concept of quasi experiments but we are speaking about the same practical cases okay? 
================
Typical examples
================
with software subject
with human subject

let's start with some practical typical examples that that can give us an overview of what we will be speaking about in this lecture. 
experiments they can be in software engineering at least like because experiments, of course, we study them in this specific 
in this specific field they can be with soft subject or with human subjects. 
so for example experiment with only software subject ARE like the one that is that is described here. 

software subject : TOOL A VS TOOL B

I have two tools 
so one tool a and one tool B 
and they do automatic testing okay ?
they're push-button tools for testing 
so I have some code (then) I press a button 
and the to test my code 
and I want to compare them in terms of different aspects 
for example 
how many bugs do they find ? and 
how fast they are in finding this bugs? etc.
so I need to compare two tools 

in this case since they are push button tools (fully automatic tools) then I do not need to involve people okay? 

so it's an experiment with only software subjects 
when I have to involves human subjects 
it is the case for exam on the human subject 
so no software subjects involved, but still in the field of software engineering there is the second example. 
===
so my research berada pada posisi HUMAN SUBJECT, yakni Method refactoring terhadap kemampuannya untuk di maintain oleh the next Maintainers ?
Maintainer akan kesulitan dengan high coupling ? 
ya beberapa riset menunjukkan change-then-fault pronennes dipengaruhi oleh dispersion coupling ?
How to consider the experience of programmer , john outsterhart tidak punya masalah dengan high LOC of Class atau high LOC of Method ?
=====
METHOD X FOR EXPERT VS NOVICES ?

so I have a certain method that is a manual strategy for finding bugs in the code. 
so I manually reviewed the code and I search for bugs according to a certain checklist, for example. 
a new checklist for finding bugs were also other defects in the code my question can be. 

how effective is this guideline, this checklist, for experts ?
and how effective is it for novices ok? 

what is the differences between novices and experts in adopting this type of method? 
so here I'm involving human subjects 
I'm studying constructs related to the subjects because D is the level of expertise here that are studying actually and I want to see 
how the the certain strategy, how the behavior of the people varries when using these specific strategies ok? 

specific strategy varies in terms of effectiveness so this effectiveness can can be again defined in different ways so how many bugs do they find out how quick are them in finding bugs so but the idea here is that while in the first example you have only software subjects in here you have only human subjects and strategy ok? but most of the time you mix it ! 

ide riset = Kombinasi tools + human

of course you have both softer subjects and human subjects because automatic tools rarely exists in software engineering.
so it is more likely that you have an interactive tool for testing and you want to see if it is more appropriate for novices or experts okay like the example before in which you have a method but in case you have a software too okay/ 
but you can have also other more complex cases. 
so you have two tools 1 both interactive and you want to compare them. 
===============
ignore level of experience ?
===============
so in this case you don't care about the level of experience. 
so now this is an expert you just want to compare them but you need to involve people because they are interactive tools for testing ok and in this case how will you select these people hey 
I will select them if I if I assume that these tools are somewhat independent on the expertise of the people I need to involve people with various expertise and within a balanced and general way so that my sample of people is somehow representative of the 

typical people 
typical population of developers 
so that somehow I eliminate I get rid of the expertise aspects 
in this experience in this expert in this specific experiment and I just compared to lay and tool be like they were automated - ok although they are interactive ok this is the general idea for this type of experiments we will see more in in detail 

this type of little tricky aspects when we will see more detailed examples you can have also other other cases. 
again you have inter - interactive tools and in this case you want to see which one is more appropriate for novices and which one is more appropriate for experts okay so expertise now becomes again a relevant aspect to consider. or you can even compare tools and approaches so for example in a company I may use a typical code review strategy with a certain checklist and I want to introduce a certain tool a ok I am comparing a tool and a method and I want to see which one is better again this is an experiment that involves software subjects so the tool but involve also involves human subject because I need to recruit people that use the actually use these approaches ok of course things become tricky if the tool is a fully automatic and the method of course requires some manual intervention so you need to you need to really take care you need to carefully consider the variable that you are evaluating in this case 
====================
Controlled experiments and theories
====================
but let's these are examples and - now let's see how this experiments are placed in our in our diagram of theory building in software engineering and in in science in general. 

basically controlled experiments are positioned our deductive approaches so are positioned in the top-down direction of this diagram so they are not using induction but they're using the duction I have a certain theory ok a certain theory taken from the literature or observed from previous more exploratory study and I formalized some hypothesis from this theory and then what I want to do is to test the hypotheses
so in this lecture you will see how to how to approach this all deductive process ok? 
that we saw last time in the context of theory building with induction abduction and deduction ok? 
what is the process for controlled experiments and at the end of this of 
these two lectures you will 
I will show you more in detail what they all these blocks mean but the idea is that taken from the from the previous slide in which you start from some theory and you go down towards the observation of reality 
here the situation is similar 
so you start from the theory you build some research question in the way that I explained last time you create hypotheses in variable definitions so you operationalize the constructs of the theory through variables as you remember the terminology that we used to and tip we do our research design that means also selecting the type of selecting the type of how many groups for example of people do I want to involve and how to map these variables into actual data that I can gather okay and in the research design I also define the measures for the different variables then I recruit the participants and I select test artifacts for my experiments collect data analyze the data it is the execution of this paramount and then I discussed several validity threats that are all related to different layers to different levels of my study I report my answers to the research question and finally I discuss how the theory changed based on my experiment so I start from a theory and I perform this study so I go top-down towards reality I test the theory really test in a quantitative way and then I discuss if the theory is confirmed in which way it is in which way my my scope of validity is extended for a certain theory with respect to previously existing studies and and so basically discussing in the end means comparing with existing work in the field and explaining in which way your experiments are advanced their knowledge in the specific field ok this is just to give you an overview of what controlled experiments are and how are they positioned in the in the process of building theories ok now let's see more in depth what are the elements that you will learn in this latch ok here you will see a lot of words that you probably do not know and they are the core elements of all the approach of the controlled experiment approach then going to explain so one fundamental element this this picture you you have to read it starting from design collect data and afterwards analyzed it okay you start from a certain hypothesis that is the right from the theory if you remember if you remember we had propositions in the theory that can be translated into some form of hypothesis we will see examples of abbath disease later on then you have the concept of independent variables dependent variables and control variables this is the identification the operationalization of the so called constructs of the of my theory and i have different so-called treatments okay we will see what are the treatments in the in very few slides okay so basically this is the design that is somehow transforming your theory in something more operational and more controllable okay then you do you collect the data so you measure this variable that you have define and you have all your data from the experiment so the experiment takes place after you designed it takes place and afterwards you have a lot of data and you have to analyze them so in the rest of the picture you have all the concepts that are needed to analyze the data in controlled experiments analyze the data most of the time means doing hypothesis testing so quantitative test of the hypotheses according to some statistical test you take what is it it's a statistical test for you it is generally a black box in which you insert a certain significant value a value that indicates how sure you want to be of your results basically and outputs to three main values the two main values and another value can be computed later on but two main value one is the test statistic that is a numerical value that doesn't mean so much in itself but is the main output let's say of the test we will see the meaning the specific meaning later on the end the p-value the pivot value is a value that while significant tells you how sure you want to be about about the results of your test the p-value indicates basically how sure can you be about the value of the test once this has been performed understanding this concept of significance and p-value will be it will be not straightforward but 
 I will do my best to to show you pictures and some graphical diagrams to allow you to to understand them at best another thing that you can extract from these analysis analyzed data is the effect size so for example the test can tell you how significant is your is your results so how sure can you be that that that your test is successful so how sure can you do for example that in this case normally that your null hypothesis is rejected but this we will see later on but how sure can you be of the conclusion of this test and the effect size is how much is this effect that are measuring with my test big large okay so one is their p-value out was telling you how much can you be confident let's say how significant is your result and the emphasize tells you how much how large is the effect is the effect that you have observed in your data okay after this analysis you have a say you have more confidence about the reliability of your hypothesis so actually we are never speaking about accepting and hypothesis but we are speaking about rejecting a null hypothesis and we will see this in the next slide some explanation some explanation about that but the idea here that you need to remember is that you start with up with a hypothesis that you don't know whether it's true or not and at the end the data analysis you may have come to ERISA that tells you these hypothesis is more likely to be true than to be false okay the left part will require your creativity so designing and also collecting data somehow because it involves selecting also the people the people involved in the experiment 

because most of the time you will deal with human and software all together requires your creativity you have to invent how to pass from your research question to variables and you need to justify the measures that you are using for the different variables 

okay and this second part is mostly automated as I said the test for you as a software engineer will be mostly a back black box, 
but you need to understand what are this concepts and how to interpret them because there is some statistics in them and it is not fully straightforward okay? 

================================================
context : slide-title : controlled experiment
================================================
so let's see more in detail what are this controlled experiment with some definition now we've seen a bit of a high level high level view of what are the different elements that you will encounter through these lectures. 
but is not now let's see let's see more formal let's say definitions okay a 
controlled experiments let's read the slide is 
"an environmental investigation of a testable hypothesis in which conditions are set up to isolate the variables of interest that are independent variables and tests how they affect certain measurable outcomes the dependent variables" 

so what does it mean look at the picture and I think is quite intuitive.
you have some input variable okay some input variable that you want to change and these are the independent variables okay the experiment is this box okay the treatments box let's call it and you want to see how certain the variables so variables of output in this box vary based on the independent one okay the treatment what is a treatment treatment is a combination of values for the independent variables what does it mean in an example can can clarify everything here for example in the in the in the case of the experiment with software tools I may have the independent variable is the test into the testing to does that I'm using okay the treatments is one treatment is with tool a and the second treatment is which will be because the testing tool as a variable can take tool a or tool B as values okay so I have two different two different treatments and the dependent variable is the thing that I want to measure for example can for example can be the number of bugs found in the software or the speed okay this is a this is the basic element of any experiment so independent variables that are also sometimes called factors okay the treatments that are combinations of values of the independent variable and the dependent variable so the measurable outcome that 
I want to observe so I changed something and I want to observe something as output it is important to consider this these are this other part what I want to do is to isolate the independent variable because I want to see just the effect on them of them on the dependent variables okay so this means that in the Oh experimental all the treatment all the other variables need to be controlled okay so in the example of the testing tool what I need to do is that the what can be the other variables that can affect my dependent ones okay what can be the other aspects the other factors that combined with the choice of the testing tool can modify the number of bugs found well obviously the type of code that I'm using for testing okay the code sample that 
I'm using for testing if this code samples need to be need to be to have a sufficient variation of number of bugs so that I can see so that they are sufficiently representative of typical code base okay? so I need to control the variable of number of bugs in code but I have also a number of bad like not number of bugs found in terms of dependent variables but number of bugs included in the code that I'm that I'm considering in the experiment included in the console but also the length of this code sample because in reality I can have different lengths and this may affect for example the speed of the tool or actually the number of bugs that a certain tool is able to find okay so this is this is to tell you that here in an email like in any controlled experiment the independent variables need to be isolated if I want to say that the variation on the dependent variable is due to the modification of the independent one otherwise if I don't control these variables what happens it happens that I may observe variation in the dependent variable but this may be caused not by the independent one but by the other variables that I didn't control so it's like being somewhat in a in a field study where I take things from reality I don't isolate elements and I see their collective impact on a certain variables but of course the validity of what I am finding and the connection between independent in the independent variable is much weaker okay so it is really important to to remember to remember this when you design an expense so again this is alighting a little bit more what we mean by controlled variable here for example I was recent the sample length the type of language also because some - maybe maybe working in only on a certain language the degree of complexity under of the code because also this may impact on the ability of the tool to to find bugs so all this variable need to be controlled they can be related to two objects like in this case in this case they are related to the different to the different code samples that I'm using in the test in the experiment and they can also be related to human subjects in this example I'm using software subjects only but if humans are involved as I as I briefly touched before you will need some representatives of different types of developers with different expertise for example if I want to make this experiment independent of the expertise of the people so I need to control the expertise variable okay what are the main characteristics that the control variables should have and at least the the sample that I'm including in this experiment should have there should be equivalent for each treatment so not equal but least equivalent they can be there should be general enough so to cover with my experiment the the largest part of my scope of interest and homogeneous they need to be homogeneous of course is another way of seeing of saying it is a way of saying that they are not emphasizing any any aspect if your if you are using for example a code sample you cannot have all all the code all the C code of a certain length and all the Java code shorter okay you need to have some some homogeneous representation datian of all the different factors in the sample that you consider and representative okay they need to represent some reality okay they need to be representative or some population of code in this case okay so it's very difficult to do this to do this election and you need to justify your selection and very often if the control variables are many you end up dealing with the needs to constrain some some dimension we will see an example later on so when when I consider you might subject as a simplified before the control variable may be related to the experience of developers for examples or age or like gender or like if you are using biometric sensor also the the color of the skin may may affect that so there there are several there are several several aspects that that may be considered to have to control your variables okay so let's go to some more formal definitions okay youyou have now a general understanding of what we are speaking about here but now we give some some definition and 
 I will generally read what's written here so we start with the definition of hypothesis where what is it is the statement that I want to test with my experiment so as I shown as I've shown I start with the hypothesis and at the end of hypothesis at the end of the hmm at the end of my experiment I have either rejected my it said I have either rejected a certain hypothesis or I have some support for that type of disease okay the apology's normally derived from a research question for example what is the difference between a and B in terms of bug detection capability the same example as before so is it better a or B for for finding bugs in this code okay I then include the hypothesis include variables that represent my contracts the costs of interest that may be tools methods actor number of bugs so all the things that may be involved in the in the experiments and that are relevant for me and the process is normally concerned the measurable impact that a certain variation or some construct can have on other constructs variation in input variable can have on output variable so variation of independent variables can have on dependent variable so to a finds more bugs than to be or to a finds less or equal box than to be okay these are examples of hypotheses that are derived from the research question and that are concerned with the specific construct in in my in my my experiments in my in my scope or in my scope of interest okay and when when we do is a potus's testing we normally have a null and alternative hypothesis okay then the null hypothesis is the one that 
 I will test okay but the one that I am trusted in is the alternative one okay this is a tricky tricky thing that you at this moment you will have to take as a fact okay when you do a part of this testing you're actually testing a null hypothesis the null hypothesis that is telling you the exact opposite of what you want to to show but it will become a little clearer later on okay at the moment you just take it as a as a as an assumption okay so more definitions again you already understood what our independent dependent variable treatment and controlled variables but here you have precise definition so independent variables are operationalization or constructs that i want to isolate whose values I want to manipulate with the example you see this is clear I work to isolate the type of tool so that I want to see just the influence of tool or I want to isolate the expertise of actors so that I just I just took I just consider that and I want to manipulate because I do different treatment because I assign different values to these independent variables then I have treatments that are actually combinations of values for the independent variables so here I have if I have to lay and tool B and I test them and I compare them I have one variable the type of tool and two treatments okay I normally speak about one factor two treatments or one variable two treatments is equivalent okay but in the books you always find one factor okay after you find quite frequently one factor two treatments okay but don't get confused with with this it's just synonyms okay or you can have if you want to to consider also the expertise as as a variable you will have four treatments because you have you need to you need to experiment with to lay an expert to lay a novices to be an expert to be a novices so you have two variables and four treatments so you see that it's easily edited your design can easily get complicated because when when you have just the tools and one variable you just run the experiments and you compare between two elements in here you just added one variable that is the expertise but you involve people you need to so you need more effort and in addition you have four treatments so you need unity enough people also to carry out this experiment in four different groups one group using to lay one group one group of experts schools using to lay one group of experts in to be etc okay dependent variables dependent variables are the output and they are operationalization of constructs that want to measure based on the manipulation of the independent variables okay so these are the constant the operationalization of those constructs that vary based on the independent variables okay for example the number of box and finally controlled variable we discuss them extensively and these are again operationalization of course but in practice they are attributes of human subjects or objects as we saw before definite to control to mask or prevent their impact on the dependent variable this controlled variable I need to control them because otherwise the variation of the dependent variable is not linked only to the variation of the independent one but may be caused by the control by this other variable okay and for example as it was exemplified multiple time I have to test on some code that is sufficiently general and equivalent for all cases let's see an example you've seen these examples on what hidden in the in the previous explanation but now let let us see it more extensively so this is example is an example of an experiment of the experiment with just software okay my goal is to understand which tool is better for testing among two available choices a and B okay these are push button tools so I don't need to consider the impact of the human in using this tool okay the independent variable we already saw it is the tool is one part okay the treatments are also straightforward so I have to lay and should be one factor to treatment what is the dependent variable well my objective is to see which one is better what do I mean by better okay better is a quite vague concept is it better in terms of speed where in terms of bugs found I want to consider both aspects so I in this case 
 I will have two dependent variable and I define them as effectiveness and efficiency so I compared the two tool in terms of effectiveness that is how many bugs do they found compared with the total number of bugs that is present in the culture because in this case I assume that the two could not be able to find some specific types of bugs and efficiency that is related to the running time and I define it as the running time in relation to the number of bugs that are found okay or I could define it also in relation to the length of the code this is just what I decided I decided this these quantities to me okay I decide what I'm interested okay in this case I have two these two dependent variable one dependent variable and two treatments okay now comes the difficult part I have to identify the control variables what and the question that I need to answer is what can impact on effectiveness and efficiency beside the type of tool well the user well the user we said no it does an impact because the tool is just a push button to is fully automatic the language of the code yes then probably is it is too hard to consider all the type of codes because it would need a too large sample and in addition one of the tool is able to test just for C so I want to focus just on C code so you see that I'm reducing my my scope of interest somehow before I was speaking about difference between today and should be in finding bugs but now I am saying that I am focusing just on C code on a certain type of language of course also another variable to take into account is the chosen code but the code shows and code samples as we exemplified before so but which are the attributes of the chosen code that my impact on the on the dependent variables where might be the actual number of bugs in the code model so I need some sufficient very a sufficient variation in terms of number of bugs in each module that I'm testing the length of the module as I said before the some tool might be more effective if it's working in shorter in shorter code so I need two quite different and realistic representation of different codes the complexity of the of the code another variable and the domain of the code why because maybe depending on the domain I a certain type of solutions that are always adopted in a certain code and a certain tool is more appropriate for the features that the code in that domain shows for example in a safety critical environment I may not be allowed to use global variables or I may not be allowed to use pointers okay so a certain tool may be more effective for the specific quality specific feature of the safety critical sector of the railway sector for example while it may not work properly if the C code is pointers and has other characteristics of course you can you can frame it in in different ways you can look at at the different and the different characteristics that of the code or you can just say ok this code is coming from a database of railway code and this code is coming from a database of I don't know financial financial software okay so these are all variables that you need to take into account and justify when you design your experiment ok so as I said I have to create a code sample that has sufficient variations you know these variables and if I can do very eight certain variable if I cannot have a sufficient variation in a certain variable I have to fix it like I did with the C code or like I'm made to need to do for the domain okay and I need to make this choice explicit as Italy mists my scope of interest okay or in this case if the theory independent it may limit your scope or validity as well but in this case you can say okay my theory I want to refocus my theory only on this domain and on this type of God okay so this creates a boundary so the controlled variable somewhat create a boundary in your scope of interest okay this is another example with software and new months okay and in this case like it is an example that we considered also before I want to see if the experience of the user affects the effectiveness of a certain tool okay the dependent variable in this case is there is the one that we took from last experiment so it's defectiveness that is the number of bugs found divided by the total number of bugs in a certain piece of code so this is the dependent variable that I want to that I want to observe while they're independent variable is is the experience of the of the user but the issue here is how can I measure this experience while before the independent variable was tool a or told B it was it was quite clear straightforward we didn't even think about measuring the independent variable because it was a binary variable basically so either you use tool a or to B but in this case your independent variable is the experience and this is how to measure it I can consider how can I measure the experience of a user where I can consider the years of experience is stay in testing or I can ask what the years of experience may tell you something but they don't tell you how much how expert is really that person so you may want to ask the colleagues to judge a certain person and to score this person for for expertise in testing okay um so in general it is better to select one independent measure for the variable okay so otherwise have many too many treatments and might not find enough participants okay so better to select one of this measure and justify but okay so let's consider since it is easier to evaluate although not necessarily perfect I consider the years but sure that you consider one year two years four years five years so by single year or can I can I group this year well if I decide that I choose one two three four as differences so I want to see how a different of one year only can affect the usage of a certain tool well this may be difficult in several terms because maybe the difference between two and three years of experience is not that much and in addition I need to find enough people for the experiment so I have to find many people who have just one year many people who have just two years many people who have three years and so it may be very complicated again as an experiment so probably is better to separate to select some levels okay how to select the level I have to do some assumptions okay I have to take some assumption take from the literature or justify and defend my decision okay there is no no silver bullet in here okay and often you resort on other studies that have done choice that is similar to yours or you you have to consider also common sense and your knowledge for example I can decide for two levels okay and in this level I have two treatments one from zero to one years novices and more than five years experts okay so in this case I have eliminated people that are in the in-between ok there is a radical difference of course between zero - one year and more than five years okay so this is evident and it is common sense that I don't need to just justify much okay so think about that of course if you have people that have between two and four years of experience and these are a candidate for your experiment you cannot use them you cannot see really you cannot involve them okay now it will identify the control variables again the question is the usual one what can impact on my outcomes besides the experience here I don't have the code I don't have the objects but I have people so in this case I can have age gender demographic variable so how old am where do they come from where did they study okay from which company are they coming from and of course again the code on which the tool is is applied okay so the other previous variable so you see that this experiment becomes much more complicated I have to make some choice I fix some some code base we use the same for a subject and make sure also in this case in say up also interacting aspects make sure none of them have shown I've seen the code in advance because if for example if I have to test certain code that I have already tested I know already which are the bugs so it's this is a this is affecting my experiment so and but all but since in some cases it may be the case that if you if you're using code from a certain company and the people are from the same company it is possible that P those people have seen that code okay and these joopa dyes your experiments okay and and then I control demographic variables okay select the rebels in a way that I have a representative group of people without imbalance in terms of age for example otherwise if I cannot do that again I restrict my scope of interest if I find just people for example you know that are all coming from the same company of course the result of my experiment is limited to the characteristic of the specific company and may be extended to companies with similar characteristics and with similar trainings for example ok so at the end this is my design and I have a group with a comparable experience novice or expert but variations in terms of age gender and other demographic aspects and I have a code base so I have designed my experience you see that here when I said this requires a lot of creativity it requires a lot of creativity you have to think truly about what are your constructs how to measure them how to create your variables how to how to measure the variables and you have to consider different factors that are also related to the possibilities that you have because when you build a software experiment a software engineering experiment you you don't have infinite resources if you had used it for example if we are involved in developers and as we said in the last lecture this developer they have to do their work their daily work so they cannot stay in your experiment for two hours and there are also fatigue and other factors that may affect the experiment so is the is really again optimizing between different factors okay so what are the pros and cons of controlled experiment the main Pro the main 


the main advantage physical experiment is that you're using you are doing really real science ok with the numbers because controlled experiments are quantitative but up to now you've never you didn't see any number ok I didn't see any number so you see that they are real 

science with numbers 
real science means also dealing a lot with the creativity with creating this constrained environment of the lab experiments of the control the spam okay and the great advantage is also that they can be applied to identifies identify cause effect relationship for specific well defined variables why as we said before the goal of the experiment is is to isolate the independent variable and control the other one so that the dependent variable is just dependent on variations variations of the independent one okay so this allows me to say when I change this I have a change in that and this change is not caused by anything else okay disadvantage there are many okay they are applicable only to well-defined problem in which you can actually define and isolate these variables as I said at the beginning if you have cases in which it is very complicated to to isolate the variable of interest because the contextual factors that may affect them are many and cannot be cannot be separated by by the measurement of the variable it is very hard to perform an experiment and they are hard also if you cannot simulate the right conditions in the rod so if the control confounding factors confounding variables may be too r2 to control so the other variable that may impact the dependent variable and the other issues that the experiment is not realistic they behavior especially the behaviorist people of people in a in an experimental environment is very different from from their behavior in the in the real world of software development but the the obvious thing is that while in a lab the experiment is carried out and in trust maybe one hour two hour maximum also because afterwards people get tired in software development you have eight hours of programming in a day or even more and in addition our dealing with the dynamic and ever-changing context with several people coming to the developers of emails coming requests coming randomly so it is a much more complex reality that changes the behavior of the developer and that influences the behavior of the developer and of course recreating this complexity in the lab is not possible even just for the matter of time okay another issue is that if you do an experiment with software with human subject is desire to recruit the subjects of course as I said develop yourself to develop and many managers need to manage so people have to work ok and recruiting people for example with expertise higher than 5 5 years it is complicated ok and very often in controlled experiment in software engineering students are used ok other PhD students or or master students ok they are proxies of develop or real-world developers but of course in practice they can rarely mimic the degree of expertise ok they are used as proxies when you want to test for example a new methodology or a new tool that you that you are proposing for software engineer what software engineers but they use it and they are used because it's easier to involve students and it it is less costly to recruit them because you may pay them a little manual or a little reward I think that is always important to give in an experiment you always have to think hey but this person why is she or he coming to the experiments either for learning something either because this person is forced but you don't want that of course and or because you give them a kind of soft reward or because they learn something from from the experience ok so you have to clean it to carefully consider this when designing the experiment thinking about recruiting as we saw in the in our example the design is time consuming we spent a lot of time thinking about the experiments and can get very complicated very easily okay so if the core the thing becomes too complicated the actual control becomes difficult okay so better the recommendation she is that better to keep your experiments simple okay otherwise your control experiment frequently risks to go out of control okay so now we pass two hypothesis testing but now first let's let's make let's make a little break okay
