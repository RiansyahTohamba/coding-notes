apa yang ingin saya ketahui?
dalam konteks experiment refactoring bagaimana dengan komposisi variable-nya?

independent = COUPLING (CINT,CDISP), size (NOM,NOC,LOC) (benarkah?)
dependent = harmfulness (benarkah?)
controlled =  experience, experimenter, env of computer, source code (ada lagi?) , tingkat pressure, 
variable dikontrol agar tidak membingungkan, sebenarnya faktor apa yang menaikkan kualitas?
bagaimana dengan teknik refactoringnya? 
treatments = refactoring (refactoring -> coupling and size)

coba bandingkan dengan contoh riset alessio.

CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT
summary
1. typical examples
a. software subject
b. Human Subject : method tertentu pada process SE : requirement gathering, refactoring
human and software subject

2. controlled experiments and theories
3. controlled experiments : process, typically quantitative
4. controlled experiments : elements
a. creativity in creating hypothesis
b. testing : this part is mostly automated, but need to understand it
c. hypothesis proven
5. diagram controlled experiments

6. definition of hypothesis

7. definition of variables (independent, dependent, controlled ) and treatments (30:52 - 34:30)

8. first example : software 

objective : which is the better tools for testing?  tools A vs tools B
independent variables = the tool (one factor)
treatments are also straightforward : tool A and B (two treatments)
dependent variable :  I have to detail what I mean by "better"?
better in terms of speed ?
better in terms of bugs found ?
alessio already have 2 dependent variable : "effectiveness" and "efficiency"
efectiveness = NBF/TNB

Now i have to identify the controlled variables : 
what can impact on "effectiveness" and "efficiency" 
language of code : only C code.
numbers of bugs in the code module (harus sama-sama 2 grup)
lengths of the module
complexity of the module
domain of the code (OS, text processing, egov, etc)
-------------
10. second example : software and human 
advantage of software	
disadvantage of software

selanjutnya : hypothesis testing
===================================

oh hello to everyone 

today we start with a some more harder material with respect to the other lectures which were giving an overview of "empirical studies in software engineering"

now we start with one of the strategies that that we listed last time 
and these "controlled experiments" 
here I put a couple of references that you can take 
to extend some to the material that you will find 
we will find in these slides 
we will go through through this topic in this lecture 

and in a key in the next lecture in which i will show you guidelines on "how to select empirical tests for controlled experiments?"

so last time to take a bit from last lecture we will show the different types of research strategies 
and we saw that experiments laboratory experiments 
controlled experiments 
in vitro experiment as a paradigm are typically strategies that require are contrived settings 
so an artificial settings , okay?? 

==============
Experiment dilakukan di lab, actually SW ENG Lab dapat hanya berupa only room. Pada ruangan tersebut kita bisa eliminasi confounding factors.
==============
not the natural one a setting in which I am for example in the lab, (of course) ! 
(lab) for software engineering experiment it doesn't necessarily need to be like a scientific lab but at least room or a space in which you can you can eliminate some "confounding factors" or some "confounding variables" as as we will see in the next slide. 

so the goal when do you use a controlled experiment 
when your goal is to "measure the behavior in a precise way" 
the behavior of whom may be very behavior of actors 
actors can be as we as we said last time 
both "software engineers" but also "tools" , okay? 
precision is the core and it is also important to highlight that these behavior needs to be related to quite clearly "identifiable variables".

FIELD STUDY VS Experiment
--------
so if the variables that you want to measure are "too complex" 
and are affected by "several factors in practice" 
(then) it is 'very unlikely' that you will use an experiment. 
it's more appropriate to use a 'field study' , okay? 

when you can isolate your variable and we will see some examples 
it is appropriate to use an experiment as a research strategy , okay? control that we speak about "controlled experiments" 
but you will find also synonyms in the literature 
so laboratory experiments but also simply experiment. 
------------
TERMINOLOGI : laboratory experiments == controlled experiments
------------------
okay? but they refer mostly to the same thing we will discuss next time a little bit about the concept of quasi experiments but we are speaking about the same practical cases , okay?? 
================
Typical examples
================
with software subject
with human subject
---
let's start with some practical typical examples :
that can give us an overview of what we will be speaking about in this lecture. 
experiments they can be in software engineering at least like because experiments, (of course), we study them in this specific 
in this specific field they can be with soft subject or with human subjects. 
---
so for example experiment with only software subject ARE like the one that is that is described here. 
---
software subject : TOOL A VS TOOL B

I have two tools 

so one tool a and one tool B 
and they do automatic testing , okay? ?
they're push-button tools for testing 

so I have some code (then) I press a button 
and the to test my code 
and I want to compare them in terms of different aspects 
for example 
how many bugs do they find ? and 
how fast they are in finding this bugs? etc.

so I need to compare two tools 

in this case since they are push button tools (fully automatic tools) then I do not need to involve people , okay?? 
so it's an experiment with only software subjects 
when I have to involves human subjects 
it is the case for exam on the human subject 

so no software subjects involved, but still in the field of software engineering there is the second example. 
-----------------------------------
pembahasan dibawah mengenai sampling people
pada riset seperti apa yg perlu dibedakan novice atau expert ?
atau random saja dan bisa dikatakan sampling kita ini adalah typical population of developer
---------------

Maintainer akan kesulitan dengan high coupling ? 
ya beberapa riset menunjukkan change-then-fault pronennes dipengaruhi oleh dispersion coupling ?
How to consider the experience of programmer , john outsterhart tidak punya masalah dengan high LOC of Class atau high LOC of Method ?
=============
so I have a certain method that is a manual strategy for finding bugs in the code. 

so I manually reviewed the code and I search for bugs according to a certain checklist, 
for example  
1. a new checklist for finding bugs were 
2. also other defects in the code my question can be. 

how effective is this guideline, this checklist, for experts ?
and how effective is it for novices ok? 

what is the differences between novices and experts in adopting this type of method ? 

so here I'm involving human subjects. 

I'm studying constructs related to the subjects 
because the level of expertise here that are studying actually 
and I want to see 
how the the certain strategy (for finding bug)
how the behavior of the people varries 
when using these specific strategies ok? 

specific strategy varies in terms of "effectiveness" 
so this "effectiveness" can be again defined in different ways 
so how many bugs do they find out 
how quick are them in finding bugs 
so but the idea here is that while in the first example you have 

only software subjects in here you have only human subjects and strategy ok? but most of the time you mix it ! 
(of course) you have both softer subjects and human subjects because automatic tools rarely exists in software engineering.

(seringkali, ide riset SE adalah mengkombinasikan tools + human)

so it is more likely that you have an interactive tool for testing and you want to see if it is more appropriate for novices or experts , okay? 

like the example before in which you have a method but in case you have a software too , okay?
but you can have also other more complex cases. 

so you have two tools :
both interactive and you want to compare them. 

so in this case you don't care about the level of experience. 

so now this is an expert 
you just want to compare them but you need to involve people 
because they are interactive tools for testing ok ?
and in this case how will you select these people hey 
I will select them if I assume that these tools are somewhat independent on the expertise of the people

I need to involve people with "various expertise"
and within "a balanced and general way" 

so that my "sample of people" is somehow representative of the typical people, "typical population of developers "

so that somehow I "eliminate" (OR) I "get rid" of the "expertise" aspects 
in this specific experiment 
and I just compared to lay and tool be like they were automated - ok ?

although they are interactive ok? 
this is the general idea for this type of experiments 

we will see more in in detail 

this type of little tricky aspects when we will see more detailed examples you can have also other other cases. 

again you have interactive tools 
and in this case you want to see 
"which one is more appropriate for novices ? " and 
"which one is more appropriate for experts ?" , okay? 

so 'expertise' now becomes 'again' a relevant "aspect to consider" 
or you can even compare tools and approaches 
so for example in a company I may use a typical code review strategy with a 'certain checklist' 

and I want to introduce a certain tool a ok? 

I am comparing a tool and a method 
and I want to see which one is better 

again this is an experiment that involves software subjects 
so the tool but involve also involves human subject 

because I need to recruit people that use the actually use 
these approaches ok (of course) things become tricky 
if the tool is a fully automatic 
and the method (of course) requires some 'manual intervention' 

so you need to 'really take care' 
you need to 'carefully consider' the variable that you are evaluating in this case 
---
harus lebih hati-hati menetapkan variable pada human subject
karena bisa saja bukan karena method XYZnya yang menyelesaikan suatu masalah tapi karena human itu sendiri yg punya kemampuan lebih (pengalaman, etc) 
lain halnya jika kita 'hanya' menguji fully automated tools yang tak perlu intervensi manual manusia, faktor manusia tidak menjadi hal berarti.
---

====================
Controlled experiments and theories
====================
controlled experiments menggunakan deductive approaches bukan inductive
deductive 
karena method ini sudah punya basis theories, entah dari literature atau study exploratory, jadi teori nya di formalkan sehingga bisa ditest dengan NHST (null hypothesis significant testing)
-----------------
but let's these are examples 
and now let's see how this experiments are placed in our diagram of theory building in software engineering and in in science in general. 

basically controlled experiments are positioned our deductive approaches 

so are positioned in the top-down direction of this diagram 

so they are not using induction but they're using deduction 
---------------------------

I have a certain theory ok? 
a certain theory taken from the literature 
or 
observed from previous more exploratory study 
and I formalized some hypothesis from this theory 
and then what I want to do is to "test the hypotheses"

so in this lecture you will see how to approach this all deductive process ok? 
that we saw last time in the context of theory building with 
induction
abduction and 
deduction, ok? 

----------------------------------------
process for controlled experiments
----------------------------------
what is the process for controlled experiments ?
and at the end of these two lectures, I will show you more in detail what they all these blocks mean ? 
(diagram, biru dan hijau yang ada di slide) 

but the idea is that taken from the previous slide in which 
you start from some theory and you go down towards the observation of reality 

here the situation is similar 

so you start from the theory 
(then) you build some research question (in the way that I explained last time)
(then) you create hypotheses in variable definitions 

1. so you operationalize the constructs of the theory through variables 
as you remember the terminology that we used to 
2. and we do our research design : that means also 
selecting the type of 
'how many groups of people do I want to involve' 
and 'how to map these variables into actual data' that I can gather , okay? 
and in the research design 
I also define the measures for the different variables 
then I recruit the participants 
and I select test artifacts for my experiments collect data analyze the data it is the execution of this paramount 
and then I discussed several validity threats that are all related to different layers to different levels of my study 

I report my answers to the research question 
and finally I discuss how the theory changed based on my experiment 

so I start from a theory 
and I perform this study so I go top-down towards reality 
(then) I test the theory, really test in a quantitative way 
and then I discuss if the theory is confirmed? 
in which way  my scope of validity is extended for a certain theory with respect to previously existing studies 

and so basically discussing in the end : means 'comparing with existing work in the field' 
and explaining in which way your experiments are 'advanced their knowledge' in the 'specific field', ok? 

this is just to give you an 'overview of '
'what controlled experiments are?' 
and how are they 'positioned in the process' of "building theories", ok? 
------------------
sampai menit 18:58
now let's see more in depth : what are the elements that you will learn in this lecture ok? 

here you will see a lot of words that you probably do not know 
(gambar element : design - collect data - analyse data)

and they are the core elements of 'all the approach of the controlled experiment' approach 

then going to explain so one fundamental element this 
this picture you you have to read it starting from design collect data and afterwards analyzed it , okay? 

you start from a certain hypothesis that is the right from the theory , if you remember we had propositions in the theory that can be 'translated into some form of hypothesis'

we will see examples of hypothesis later on 

then you have the concept of 
independent variables 
dependent variables and 
control variables 

this is the identification the operationalization of the 
so called constructs of the of my theory and i have different 
so-called treatments , okay? 
we will see what are the treatments in the in very few slides , okay? 
so basically this is the design that is somehow transforming your theory in something more operational and more controllable , okay? then you do you collect the data 
so you measure this variable that you have define and you have all your data from the experiment 
so the experiment takes place after you designed it takes place and afterwards you have a lot of data and you have to analyze them 
so in the rest of the picture you have all the concepts that are needed to analyze 

the data in controlled experiments analyze the data most of the time means doing hypothesis testing 


so quantitative test of the hypotheses according to some statistical test you take what is 

it's a statistical test for you it is generally a black box in which you insert a certain significant value a value that indicates how sure you want to be of your results basically and outputs to three main values 

the two main values and another value can be computed later on but two main value one is the test statistic that is a numerical value that doesn't mean 
so much in itself but is the main output let's say of the test we will see the meaning the specific meaning later on the end 

the p-value the pivot value is a value that while significant tells you how sure you want to be about about the results of your test the p-value indicates basically how sure can you be about the value of the test once this has been performed understanding this concept of significance and p-value will be it will be not straightforward but 
I will do my best to to show you pictures and some graphical diagrams to allow you to to understand them at best another thing that you can extract from these analysis analyzed data is the effect size 
so for example the test can tell you how significant is your is your results 

so how sure can you be that that that your test is successful 
so how sure can you do for example that in this case normally that your null hypothesis is rejected but this we will see later on but how sure can you be of the conclusion of this test and the effect size is how much is this effect that are measuring with my test big large , okay? 
so one is their p-value out was telling you how much can you be confident let's say how significant is your result and the emphasize tells you how much how large is the effect is the effect that you have observed in your data , okay? after this analysis you have a say you have more confidence about the reliability of your hypothesis 
so actually we are never speaking about accepting and hypothesis but we are speaking about rejecting a null hypothesis and we will see this in the next slide some explanation some explanation about that but the idea here that you need to remember is that you start with up with a hypothesis that you don't know whether it's true or not and at the end the data analysis you may have come to ERISA that tells you these hypothesis is more likely to be true than to be false , okay? the left part will require your creativity 
so designing and also collecting data somehow because it involves selecting also the people the people involved in the experiment 

because most of the time you will deal with human and software all together requires your creativity you have to invent how to pass from your research question to variables and you need to justify the measures that you are using for the different variables 

, okay? and this second part is mostly automated as I said the test for you as a software engineer will be mostly a back black box, 
but you need to understand what are this concepts and how to interpret them because there is some statistics in them and it is not fully straightforward , okay?? 

================================================
slide-title : controlled experiment
start menit 18:58 - 
================================================

so let's see more in detail what are this controlled experiment with some definition now we've seen a bit of a high level high level view of what are the different elements that you will encounter through these lectures. 
but is not now let's see let's see more formal let's say definitions , okay? a 
controlled experiments let's read the slide is 

"an environmental investigation of a testable hypothesis in which conditions are set up to isolate the variables of interest that are independent variables and tests how they affect certain measurable outcomes the dependent variables" 


so what does it mean look at the picture and I think is quite intuitive.
you have some input variable , okay? some input variable that you want to change and these are the independent variables , okay? the experiment is this box , okay? the treatments box let's call it and you want to see how certain the variables 
so variables of output in this box vary based on the independent one , okay? the treatment what is a treatment treatment is a combination of values for the independent variables what does it mean in an example can can clarify everything here for example in the in the in the case of the experiment with software tools I may have the independent variable is the test into the testing to does that I'm using , okay? the treatments is one treatment is with tool a and the second treatment is which will be because the testing tool as a variable can take tool a or tool B as values , okay? 
so I have two different two different treatments and the dependent variable is the thing that I want to measure for example can for example can be the number of bugs found in the software or the speed , okay? this is a this is the basic element of any experiment 
so independent variables that are also sometimes called factors , okay? the treatments that are combinations of values of the independent variable and the dependent variable 
so the measurable outcome that 
I want to observe ! 
so I changed something and I want to observe something as output it is important to consider this these are this other part what I want to do is to isolate the independent variable because I want to see just the effect on them of them on the dependent variables , okay? 
so this means that in the Oh experimental all the treatment all the other variables need to be controlled , okay? 
so in the example of the testing tool what I need to do is that the what can be the other variables that can affect my dependent ones , okay? what can be the other aspects the other factors that combined with the choice of the testing tool can modify the number of bugs found well obviously the type of code that I'm using for testing , okay? the code sample that 
I'm using for testing if this code samples need to be need to be to have a sufficient variation of number of bugs 
so that I can see 
so that they are sufficiently representative of typical code base , okay?? 
so I need to control the variable of number of bugs in code but I have also a number of bad like not number of bugs found in terms of dependent variables but number of bugs included in the code that I'm that I'm considering in the experiment included in the console but also the length of this code sample because in reality I can have different lengths and this may affect for example the speed of the tool or actually the number of bugs that a certain tool is able to find , okay? 
so this is this is to tell you that here in an email like in any controlled experiment the independent variables need to be isolated if I want to say that the variation on the dependent variable is due to the modification of the independent one otherwise if I don't control these variables what happens it happens that I may observe variation in the dependent variable but this may be caused not by the independent one but by the other variables that I didn't control 
so it's like being somewhat in a in a field study where I take things from reality I don't isolate elements and I see their collective impact on a certain variables but (of course) the validity of what I am finding and the connection between independent in the independent variable is much weaker , okay? 
so it is really important to to remember to remember this when you design an expense 
=============================
slide baru menit 24:32
independent variable -> treatments -> dependent variable
penambahan penjelasan controlled variable pada kotak treatments
=============================

so again this is alighting a little bit more what we mean by controlled variable here for example I was recent the sample length the type of language also because some - maybe maybe working in only on a certain language the degree of complexity under of the code because also this may impact on the ability of the tool to to find bugs 
so all this variable need to be controlled they can be related to two objects like in this case in this case they are related to the different to the different code samples that I'm using in the test in the experiment and they can also be related to human subjects in this example I'm using software subjects only but if humans are involved as I as I briefly touched before you will need some representatives of different types of developers with different expertise for example if I want to make this experiment independent of the expertise of the people 
so I need to control the expertise variable , okay? what are the main characteristics that the control variables should have and at least the the sample that I'm including in this experiment should have there should be equivalent for each treatment 
so not equal but least equivalent they can be there should be general enough 
so to cover with my experiment the the largest part of my scope of interest and homogeneous they need to be homogeneous (of course) is another way of seeing of saying it is a way of saying that they are not emphasizing any any aspect if your if you are using for example a code sample you cannot have all all the code all the C code of a certain length and all the Java code shorter , okay? you need to have some some homogeneous representation datian of all the different factors in the sample that you consider and representative , okay? they need to represent some reality , okay? they need to be representative or some population of code in this case , okay? 
so it's very difficult to do this to do this election and you need to justify your selection and very often if the control variables are many you end up dealing with the needs to constrain some some dimension we will see an example later on 
so when when I consider you might subject as a simplified before the control variable may be related to the experience of developers for examples or age or like gender or like if you are using biometric sensor also the the color of the skin may may affect that 
so there there are several there are several several aspects that that may be considered to have to control your variables , okay?
