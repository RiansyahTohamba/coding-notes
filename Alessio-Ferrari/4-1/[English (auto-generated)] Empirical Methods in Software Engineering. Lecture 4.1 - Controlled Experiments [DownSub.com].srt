00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
oh hello to everyone today we we start

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,899
with a some more hi some harder material

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,730
with respect to the other lectures which

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,210
were giving an overview of empirical

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,460
studies in software engineering now we

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,210
start with with one of the strategies

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,660
that that we listed last time and these

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,650
controlled experiments here I put a

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,779
couple of references that you can take

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,769
for to extend some to extend the

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,600
material that you will find we will find

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
in these slides we will go through

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,670
through this topic in this lecture and

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,030
in a key in the next in the next lecture

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,730
in which I will show you guidelines on

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,390
how to select to select empirical tests

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,350
for controlled experiments so last time

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,610
to take take a bit from last lecture we

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,350
will show the different types of

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,500
research strategies and we saw that

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,180
experiments laboratory experiments

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,250
controlled experiments in vitro

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,820
experiment as a paradigm are typically

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,420
strategies that require are contrived

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,630
settings so an artificial settings okay

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,540
not the natural one a setting in which I

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,180
am for example in the lab of course for

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,890
software engineering experiment it

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,770
doesn't necessarily need to be like a

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,670
scientific lab but at least room or a

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,720
space in which you can you can eliminate

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,509
some confounding factors or some

33
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,500
confounding variables as as we will see

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,979
in the next slide so the goal when do

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,979
you use a controlled experiment when

36
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,939
your goal is to measure the behavior in

37
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,700
a precise way the behavior of whom may

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,579
be very behavior of actors actors can be

39
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,840
as we as we said last time both software

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,950
engineers but also tools okay

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,200
precision is the core and it is also

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,780
important to highlight that these

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,050
behavior needs to be related to quite

44
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,090
clearly

45
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,210
identifiable variables so if if the

46
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,310
variables that you want to measure are

47
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,140
too complex and are affected by several

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,980
factors in practice it is very unlikely

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,820
that you will use an experiment it's

50
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,070
more appropriate to use a field study

51
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,730
okay when you can isolate your variable

52
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,540
and we will see some examples it is

53
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,670
appropriate to use an experiment as a

54
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,980
research strategy okay

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,050
control that we speak about controlled

56
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,610
experiments but you will find also

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,590
synonyms in the literature so laboratory

58
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,260
experiments but also simply experiment

59
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,500
okay but they refer mostly to the same

60
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,890
thing we will discuss next time a little

61
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,260
bit about the concept of quasi

62
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,290
experiments but we are speaking about

63
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,090
the same practical cases okay let's

64
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,770
start with some practical typical

65
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,799
examples that that can give us an

66
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,110
overview of what we will be speaking

67
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,519
about in this lecture experiments they

68
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,739
can be in software engineering at least

69
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,709
like because experiments of course we

70
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:35,280
study them in this in this specific in

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,590
this specific field they can be with

72
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,280
soft subject or with human subjects so

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,590
for example experiment with only

74
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,380
software subject arla like the one that

75
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,049
is that is described here I have two

76
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,860
tools so one tool a and one tool B and

77
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,250
they they do automatic testing okay

78
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,380
they're push-button tools for testing so

79
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,930
I have some code I press a button and

80
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,350
the to test my code and I want to

81
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,049
compare them I want to compare them in

82
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,660
terms of different aspects for example

83
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,709
how many bugs do they find and how how

84
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,738
fast they are in finding this box etc so

85
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,959
I need to compare two tools in this case

86
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,390
since they are push button tools out of

87
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,310
my completely out of fully automatic

88
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,830
tools I don't I do not need to involve

89
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,630
people okay

90
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,910
so it's an experiment with only software

91
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,840
subjects when I have to involves human

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,780
subjects it is the case for exam on the

93
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,880
human subject so no software subjects

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,980
involved but still in the field of

95
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,340
software engineering there is the second

96
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,640
example so I have a certain method that

97
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,130
is a man was strategy for finding bugs

98
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,470
in the code so I review manually

99
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,870
reviewed the code and I search for bugs

100
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,880
according I don't know according to a

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,920
certain checklist for example a new

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,340
checklist for finding bugs were also

103
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,670
other defects in the code my question

104
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,530
can be how effective is this guideline

105
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,930
Dizz checklist for experts and how

106
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,810
effective is it for novices ok what is

107
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,270
the differences between novices and

108
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,510
experts in adopting this type of method

109
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,870
so here I'm involving human subjects

110
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,390
I'm studying constructs related to to

111
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,430
the subjects because D is the level of

112
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,200
expertise here that are studying

113
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,270
actually and I want to see how the the

114
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,190
certain strategy how the how the

115
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,730
behavior of the people berries when

116
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,670
using these specific strategies ok

117
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,650
specific strategy varies in terms of

118
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,430
effectiveness

119
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,730
so this effectiveness can can be again

120
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,590
defined in different ways so how many

121
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,500
bugs do they find out how quick are them

122
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,420
in finding bugs so but the idea here is

123
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,520
that while in the first example you have

124
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,590
only softer subjects in here you have

125
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,600
only human subjects and strategy ok but

126
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,940
most of the time you mix it of course

127
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,790
you have both softer subjects and human

128
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,010
subjects because out of my fully

129
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,380
automatic tools rarely exists in

130
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,420
software engineering so it is more

131
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,390
likely that you have an interactive tool

132
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,880
for testing and you want to see if it is

133
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,950
more appropriate for novices or experts

134
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,880
okay

135
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,610
like the example before in which you

136
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,320
have a method but in case you have a

137
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,370
softer too okay but you can have also

138
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,830
other more complex cases so you have two

139
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,460
tools

140
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,310
1 both interactive and you want to

141
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,980
compare them so in this case you do you

142
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,700
don't care about the level of experience

143
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,280
so now this is an expert you just want

144
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,160
to compare them but you need to involve

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,230
people because they are interactive

146
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,770
tools for testing ok and in this case

147
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,230
how will you select these people hey I

148
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,020
will select them if I if I assume that

149
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,130
these tools are somewhat independent on

150
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,710
the expertise of the people I need to

151
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,290
involve people with various expertise

152
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,200
and within a balanced and general way so

153
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,810
that my sample of people is somehow

154
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,450
representative of the typical people

155
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,580
typical population of developers so that

156
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,140
somehow I eliminate I get rid of the

157
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,920
expertise aspects in this experience in

158
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,020
this expert in this specific experiment

159
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,690
and I just compared to lay and tool be

160
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,200
like they were automated - ok although

161
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,360
they are interactive ok this is the

162
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,860
general idea for this type of

163
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,170
experiments we will see more in in

164
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,590
detail this type of little little tricky

165
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,810
aspects when we will see more detailed

166
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,650
examples you can have also other other

167
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,800
cases again you have inter - interactive

168
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
tools and in this case you want to see

169
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,210
which one is more appropriate for

170
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,740
novices and which one is more

171
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,350
appropriate for experts okay so

172
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,170
expertise now becomes again a relevant

173
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,770
aspect to consider or you can even

174
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,530
compare tools and approaches so for

175
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,440
example in a company I may use a typical

176
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,200
code review strategy with a certain

177
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,560
checklist and I want to introduce a

178
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,860
certain tool a ok I am comparing a tool

179
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,070
and a method and I want to see which one

180
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,850
is better

181
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,340
again this is an experiment that

182
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,039
involves software subjects so the tool

183
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,130
but involve also involves human subject

184
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,600
because I need to recruit people that

185
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,500
use the actually use these approaches ok

186
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,290
of course things become tricky

187
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,450
if the tool is a fully automatic and the

188
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,010
method of course requires some manual

189
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,920
intervention so you need to you need to

190
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,590
really take care you need to carefully

191
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,630
consider the variable that you are

192
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,590
evaluating in this case but let's let's

193
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,960
these are these are examples and - now

194
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,290
let's see how this experiments are

195
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:28,110
placed in our in our diagram of theory

196
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,600
building in software engineering and in

197
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,300
in science in general basically

198
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,340
controlled experiments are positioned

199
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,950
our deductive approaches so are

200
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,870
positioned in the top-down direction of

201
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,790
this diagram so they are not using

202
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,590
induction but they're using the duction

203
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,320
I have a certain theory ok a certain

204
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,480
theory taken from the literature or

205
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,320
observed from previous more exploratory

206
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,480
study and I formalized some hypothesis

207
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,180
from this theory and then what I want to

208
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,750
do is to test the hypotheses so in this

209
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,770
lecture you will see how to how to

210
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,650
approach this all deductive process ok

211
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,650
that that we saw last time in the

212
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,800
context of theory building with

213
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,270
induction abduction and adduction ok

214
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,490
what is the process for controlled

215
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,370
experiments and at the end of this of

216
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,070
these two lectures you will I will show

217
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,110
you more in detail what they all these

218
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,070
blocks mean but the idea is that taken

219
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,070
from the from the previous slide in

220
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,950
which you start from some theory and you

221
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,130
go down towards the observation of

222
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,040
reality here the situation is similar so

223
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,470
you start from the theory you build some

224
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,120
research question in the way that I

225
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,590
explained last time you create

226
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,600
hypotheses in variable definitions so

227
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,720
you operationalize the constructs of the

228
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,120
theory through variables as you remember

229
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,780
the terminology that we used to

230
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,810
and tip we do our research design that

231
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,940
means also selecting the type of

232
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,660
selecting the type of how many groups

233
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,550
for example of people do I want to

234
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,940
involve and how to map these variables

235
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,550
into actual data that I can gather okay

236
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,460
and in the research design I also define

237
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,040
the measures for the different variables

238
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,830
then I recruit the participants and I

239
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,170
select test artifacts for my experiments

240
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,110
collect data analyze the data it is the

241
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,540
execution of this paramount and then I

242
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,700
discussed several validity threats that

243
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,430
are all related to different layers to

244
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,510
different levels of my study I report my

245
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,340
answers to the research question and

246
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,970
finally I discuss how the theory changed

247
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,530
based on my experiment so I start from a

248
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,670
theory and I perform this study so I go

249
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,450
top-down towards reality I test the

250
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,180
theory really test in a quantitative way

251
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,930
and then I discuss if the theory is

252
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,790
confirmed in which way it is in which

253
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,470
way my my scope of validity is extended

254
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,140
for a certain theory with respect to

255
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,260
previously existing studies and and so

256
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,650
basically discussing in the end means

257
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,090
comparing with existing work in the

258
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,400
field and explaining in which way your

259
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,070
experiments are advanced their knowledge

260
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,890
in the specific field ok this is just to

261
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,150
give you an overview of what controlled

262
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,400
experiments are and how are they

263
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,170
positioned in the in the process of

264
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,260
building theories ok now let's see more

265
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,660
in depth what are the elements that you

266
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,240
will learn in this latch ok here you

267
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,180
will see a lot of words that you

268
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,910
probably do not know and they are the

269
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,050
core elements of all the approach of the

270
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,850
controlled experiment approach then

271
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,940
going to explain so one fundamental

272
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,520
element this this picture you you have

273
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,040
to read it starting from design collect

274
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,790
data and afterwards analyzed it okay you

275
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,310
start from a certain hypothesis that is

276
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,750
the right from the theory if you

277
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,430
remember if you remember we had

278
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,830
propositions in the theory that can be

279
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,440
translated into some form of hypothesis

280
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,930
we will see examples of abbath disease

281
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,220
later on then you have the concept of

282
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,390
independent variables dependent

283
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,730
variables and control variables this is

284
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,450
the identification the

285
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,030
operationalization of the so called

286
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,870
constructs of the of my theory and i

287
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,930
have different so-called treatments okay

288
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,150
we will see what are the treatments in

289
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,970
the in very few slides okay so basically

290
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,270
this is the design that is somehow

291
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,280
transforming your theory in something

292
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,770
more operational and more controllable

293
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,060
okay then you do you collect the data so

294
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,980
you measure this variable that you have

295
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,960
define and you have all your data from

296
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,510
the experiment so the experiment takes

297
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,090
place after you designed it takes place

298
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,850
and afterwards you have a lot of data

299
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,280
and you have to analyze them so in the

300
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,620
rest of the picture you have all the

301
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,810
concepts that are needed to analyze the

302
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,230
data in controlled experiments analyze

303
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,800
the data most of the time means doing

304
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,460
hypothesis testing

305
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,850
so quantitative test of the hypotheses

306
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,960
according to some statistical test you

307
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,840
take what is it it's a statistical test

308
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,220
for you it is generally a black box in

309
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,730
which you insert a certain significant

310
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,120
value a value that indicates how sure

311
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,130
you want to be of your results basically

312
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,050
and outputs to three main values the two

313
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,760
main values and another value can be

314
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,090
computed later on but two main value one

315
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,250
is the test statistic that is a

316
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,710
numerical value that doesn't mean so

317
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,030
much in itself but is the main output

318
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,010
let's say of the test we will see the

319
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,040
meaning the specific meaning later on

320
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,080
the end the p-value the pivot

321
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,080
value is a value that while significant

322
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,540
tells you how sure you want to be about

323
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,080
about the results of your test the

324
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,980
p-value indicates basically how sure can

325
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,040
you be about the value of the test once

326
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,130
this has been performed understanding

327
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,180
this concept of significance and p-value

328
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,070
will be it will be not straightforward

329
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,070
but I will do my best to to show you

330
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,920
pictures and some graphical diagrams to

331
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,710
allow you to to understand them at best

332
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,510
another thing that you can extract from

333
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,080
these analysis analyzed data is the

334
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,780
effect size so for example the test can

335
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,960
tell you how significant is your is your

336
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,040
results so how sure can you be that that

337
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,190
that your test is successful so how sure

338
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,310
can you do for example that in this case

339
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,070
normally that your null hypothesis is

340
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,040
rejected but this we will see later on

341
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,320
but how sure can you be of the

342
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,750
conclusion of this test and the effect

343
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,670
size is how much is this effect that are

344
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,320
measuring with my test big large okay so

345
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,330
one is their p-value out was telling you

346
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,330
how much can you be confident let's say

347
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,970
how significant is your result and the

348
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,780
emphasize tells you how much how large

349
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,230
is the effect is the effect that you

350
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,199
have observed in your data okay after

351
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,780
this analysis you have a say you have

352
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:26,329
more confidence about the reliability of

353
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,750
your hypothesis so actually we are never

354
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,140
speaking about accepting and hypothesis

355
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,090
but we are speaking about rejecting a

356
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,580
null hypothesis and we will see this in

357
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,670
the next slide some explanation some

358
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,470
explanation about that but the idea here

359
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,360
that you need to remember is that you

360
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,520
start with up with a hypothesis that you

361
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,620
don't know whether it's true or not and

362
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,790
at the end

363
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,150
the data analysis you may have come to

364
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,990
ERISA that tells you these hypothesis is

365
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,750
more likely to be true than to be false

366
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,240
okay

367
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,370
the left part will require your

368
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,060
creativity so designing and also

369
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,800
collecting data somehow because it

370
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,920
involves selecting also the people the

371
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,090
people involved in the experiment

372
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,160
because most of the time you will deal

373
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,760
with human and software all together

374
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,040
requires your creativity you have to

375
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,470
invent how to pass from your research

376
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,900
question to variables and you need to

377
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,510
justify the measures that you are using

378
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,410
for the different variables okay and

379
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,900
this second part is mostly automated as

380
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,740
I said the test for you as a software

381
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,490
engineer will be mostly a back black box

382
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,560
but you need to understand what are this

383
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,780
concepts and how to interpret them

384
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,860
because there is some statistics in them

385
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:57,220
and it is not fully straightforward okay

386
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:00,200
so let's see more in detail what are

387
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,090
this controlled experiment with some

388
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,110
definition now we've seen a bit of a

389
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,080
high level high level view of what are

390
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,000
the different elements that you will

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,070
encounter through these lectures but is

392
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,410
not now let's see let's see more formal

393
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,780
let's say definitions okay a controlled

394
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,420
experiments let's let's read the slide

395
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,420
is an environmental investigation of a

396
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,210
testable hypothesis in which conditions

397
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,610
are set up to isolate the variables of

398
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,530
interest that are independent variables

399
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,950
and tests how they affect certain

400
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,170
measurable outcomes the dependent

401
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,800
variables so what does it mean look at

402
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,450
the picture and I think is quite

403
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,020
intuitive you have some input variable

404
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,630
okay some input variable that you want

405
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,510
to change and these are the independent

406
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,040
variables okay

407
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,190
the experiment is this box okay the

408
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,230
treatments box let's call it and you

409
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,110
want to see how certain the

410
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,600
variables so variables of output in this

411
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,299
box vary based on the independent one

412
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:15,080
okay the treatment what is a treatment

413
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,980
treatment is a combination of values for

414
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,280
the independent variables what does it

415
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,730
mean in an example can can clarify

416
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,450
everything here for example in the in

417
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,440
the in the case of the experiment with

418
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,780
software tools I may have the

419
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,179
independent variable is the test into

420
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:40,880
the testing to does that I'm using okay

421
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,330
the treatments is one treatment is with

422
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,549
tool a and the second treatment is which

423
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,830
will be because the testing tool as a

424
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,679
variable can take tool a or tool B as

425
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,880
values okay so I have two different two

426
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,429
different treatments and the dependent

427
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,370
variable is the thing that I want to

428
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,770
measure for example can for example can

429
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,020
be the number of bugs found in the

430
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,970
software or the speed okay this is a

431
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,650
this is the basic element of any

432
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,780
experiment so independent variables that

433
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,470
are also sometimes called factors okay

434
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,720
the treatments that are combinations of

435
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,030
values of the independent variable and

436
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,250
the dependent variable so the measurable

437
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,650
outcome that I want to observe so I

438
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,809
changed something and I want to observe

439
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:37,220
something as output it is important to

440
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,040
consider this these are this other part

441
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,280
what I want to do is to isolate the

442
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,350
independent variable because I want to

443
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,720
see just the effect on them of them on

444
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,710
the dependent variables okay so this

445
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,799
means that in the Oh experimental all

446
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,110
the treatment all the other variables

447
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,160
need to be controlled okay so in the

448
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,740
example of the testing tool what I need

449
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,910
to do is that the what can be the other

450
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,240
variables that can affect my dependent

451
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,909
ones okay what can be the

452
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,309
other aspects the other factors that

453
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,460
combined with the choice of the testing

454
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,849
tool can modify the number of bugs found

455
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:29,989
well obviously the type of code that I'm

456
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:32,960
using for testing okay the code sample

457
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,080
that I'm using for testing if this code

458
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,619
samples need to be need to be to have a

459
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:42,169
sufficient variation of number of bugs

460
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,109
so that I can see so that they are

461
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:48,139
sufficiently representative of typical

462
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:52,039
code base okay so I need to control the

463
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,070
variable of number of bugs in code but I

464
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,830
have also a number of bad like not

465
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,989
number of bugs found in terms of

466
00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:01,929
dependent variables but number of bugs

467
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:04,970
included in the code that I'm that I'm

468
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,029
considering in the experiment included

469
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:10,399
in the console but also the length of

470
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,440
this code sample because in reality I

471
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,119
can have different lengths and this may

472
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,489
affect for example the speed of the tool

473
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:19,820
or actually the number of bugs that a

474
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,119
certain tool is able to find okay so

475
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,869
this is this is to tell you that here in

476
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,330
an email like in any controlled

477
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,820
experiment the independent variables

478
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,820
need to be isolated if I want to say

479
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,999
that the variation on the dependent

480
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,419
variable is due to the modification of

481
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,359
the independent one otherwise if I don't

482
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,179
control these variables what happens it

483
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,369
happens that I may observe variation in

484
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,769
the dependent variable but this may be

485
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:55,909
caused not by the independent one but by

486
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:57,590
the other variables that I didn't

487
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,669
control so it's like being somewhat in a

488
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,639
in a field study where I take things

489
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:05,809
from reality

490
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:10,009
I don't isolate elements and I see their

491
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,979
collective impact on a certain variables

492
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:16,279
but of course the validity of what I am

493
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:19,129
finding and the connection between

494
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:21,679
independent in the independent variable

495
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,179
is much weaker okay so it is really

496
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:28,429
important to to remember to remember

497
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:31,750
this when you design an expense

498
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,540
so again this is alighting a little bit

499
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,210
more what we mean by controlled variable

500
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,670
here for example I was recent the sample

501
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,040
length the type of language also because

502
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,790
some - maybe maybe working in only on a

503
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,290
certain language the degree of

504
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,030
complexity under of the code because

505
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,430
also this may impact on the ability of

506
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,140
the tool to to find bugs so all this

507
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,000
variable need to be controlled they can

508
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,090
be related to two objects like in this

509
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,490
case in this case they are related to

510
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,050
the different to the different code

511
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,990
samples that I'm using in the test in

512
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,020
the experiment and they can also be

513
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,460
related to human subjects in this

514
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,210
example I'm using software subjects only

515
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,110
but if humans are involved as I as I

516
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,440
briefly touched before you will need

517
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,530
some representatives of different types

518
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,050
of developers with different expertise

519
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,930
for example if I want to make this

520
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,810
experiment independent of the expertise

521
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,120
of the people so I need to control the

522
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,000
expertise variable okay what are the

523
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,760
main characteristics that the control

524
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,700
variables should have and at least the

525
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,800
the sample that I'm including in this

526
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,050
experiment should have there should be

527
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,090
equivalent for each treatment so not

528
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,420
equal but least equivalent they can be

529
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,510
there should be general enough so to

530
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,220
cover with my experiment the the largest

531
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,320
part of my scope of interest and

532
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,970
homogeneous they need to be homogeneous

533
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,060
of course is another way of seeing of

534
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,120
saying it is a way of saying that they

535
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,350
are not emphasizing any any aspect if

536
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,320
your if you are using for example a code

537
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,250
sample you cannot have all all the code

538
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,120
all the C code of a certain length and

539
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,030
all the Java code shorter okay you need

540
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,760
to have some some homogeneous

541
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,659
representation

542
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:47,179
datian of all the different factors in

543
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,840
the sample that you consider and

544
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,039
representative okay they need to

545
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,549
represent some reality okay they need to

546
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:58,519
be representative or some population of

547
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,249
code in this case okay so it's very

548
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:03,529
difficult to do this to do this election

549
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:05,450
and you need to justify your selection

550
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,369
and very often if the control variables

551
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:13,700
are many you end up dealing with the

552
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,580
needs to constrain some some dimension

553
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,200
we will see an example later on so when

554
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,139
when I consider you might subject as a

555
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:27,019
simplified before the control variable

556
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,539
may be related to the experience of

557
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:33,440
developers for examples or age or like

558
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,869
gender or like if you are using

559
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:39,979
biometric sensor also the the color of

560
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:44,479
the skin may may affect that so there

561
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,379
there are several there are several

562
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,940
several aspects that that may be

563
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,389
considered to have to control your

564
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,749
variables okay so let's go to some more

565
00:27:56,749 --> 00:28:00,379
formal definitions okay youyou have now

566
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,450
a general understanding of what we are

567
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,710
speaking about here but now we give some

568
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,840
some definition and I will generally

569
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,330
read what's written here so we start

570
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,580
with the definition of hypothesis where

571
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,649
what is it is the statement that I want

572
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:18,049
to test with my experiment so as I shown

573
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:21,590
as I've shown I start with the

574
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,080
hypothesis and at the end of hypothesis

575
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,359
at the end of the hmm at the end of my

576
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:34,129
experiment I have either rejected my it

577
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,499
said I have either rejected a certain

578
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:39,529
hypothesis or I have some support for

579
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:41,450
that type of disease okay the apology's

580
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,879
normally derived from a research

581
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:46,700
question for example what is the

582
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,889
difference between a and B in terms of

583
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:50,539
bug detection capability the same

584
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,210
example as before so is it better

585
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,149
a or B for for finding bugs in this code

586
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:57,610
okay

587
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,570
I then include the hypothesis include

588
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,910
variables that represent my contracts

589
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,250
the costs of interest that may be tools

590
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,460
methods actor number of bugs so all the

591
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,060
things that may be involved in the in

592
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,040
the experiments and that are relevant

593
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,220
for me and the process is normally

594
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,800
concerned the measurable impact that a

595
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,890
certain variation or some construct can

596
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,800
have on other constructs variation in

597
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,460
input variable can have on output

598
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,310
variable so variation of independent

599
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,770
variables can have on dependent variable

600
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,850
so to a finds more bugs than to be or to

601
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,310
a finds less or equal box than to be

602
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,970
okay these are examples of hypotheses

603
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,020
that are derived from the research

604
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,290
question and that are concerned with the

605
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:59,850
specific construct in in my in my my

606
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,580
experiments in my in my scope or in my

607
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,840
scope of interest okay and when when we

608
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,330
do is a potus's testing we normally have

609
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,060
a null and alternative hypothesis okay

610
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,270
then the null hypothesis is the one that

611
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,120
I will test okay but the one that I am

612
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,090
trusted in is the alternative one okay

613
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,690
this is a tricky tricky thing that you

614
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,150
at this moment you will have to take as

615
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,580
a fact okay when you do a part of this

616
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,400
testing you're actually testing a null

617
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,770
hypothesis the null hypothesis that is

618
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,440
telling you the exact opposite of what

619
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,900
you want to to show but it will become a

620
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,220
little clearer later on okay at the

621
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,540
moment you just take it as a as a as an

622
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,200
assumption okay so more definitions

623
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,450
again you already understood what our

624
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,240
independent dependent variable treatment

625
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,040
and controlled variables but here you

626
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,740
have precise definition so independent

627
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,250
variables are operationalization or

628
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,260
constructs that i want to isolate

629
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,750
whose values I want to manipulate with

630
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,420
the example you see this is clear I work

631
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,330
to isolate the type of tool so that I

632
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,390
want to see just the influence of tool

633
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,270
or I want to isolate the expertise of

634
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:29,170
actors so that I just I just took I just

635
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,760
consider that and I want to manipulate

636
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,400
because I do different treatment because

637
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,390
I assign different values to these

638
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,220
independent variables then I have

639
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,480
treatments that are actually

640
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,000
combinations of values for the

641
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,060
independent variables so here I have if

642
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,730
I have to lay and tool B and I test them

643
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,530
and I compare them I have one variable

644
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,230
the type of tool and two treatments okay

645
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,360
I normally speak about one factor two

646
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,070
treatments or one variable two

647
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,730
treatments is equivalent okay but in the

648
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,240
books you always find one factor okay

649
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,860
after you find quite frequently one

650
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,800
factor two treatments okay but don't get

651
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,630
confused with with this it's just

652
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,950
synonyms okay or you can have if you

653
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,890
want to to consider also the expertise

654
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,730
as as a variable you will have four

655
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,070
treatments because you have you need to

656
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,440
you need to experiment with to lay an

657
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,890
expert to lay a novices to be an expert

658
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,350
to be a novices so you have two

659
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,320
variables and four treatments so you see

660
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,250
that it's easily edited your design can

661
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,640
easily get complicated because when when

662
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,770
you have just the tools and one variable

663
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,170
you just run the experiments and you

664
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,320
compare between two elements in here you

665
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,420
just added one variable that is the

666
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,720
expertise but you involve people you

667
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,810
need to so you need more effort and in

668
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,030
addition you have four treatments so you

669
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,120
need unity enough people also to carry

670
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,940
out this experiment in four different

671
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,120
groups one group using to lay one group

672
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,700
one group of experts schools using to

673
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,420
lay one group of experts in to be etc

674
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,710
okay dependent variables dependent

675
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,500
variables are the output and they are

676
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,180
operationalization of constructs that

677
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,860
want to measure based on the

678
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,480
manipulation of the independent

679
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,810
variables okay so these are the constant

680
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,640
the operationalization of those

681
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,250
constructs that vary based on the

682
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,620
independent variables okay for example

683
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,750
the number of box and finally controlled

684
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,150
variable we discuss them extensively and

685
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,330
these are again operationalization of

686
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,820
course but in practice they are

687
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,460
attributes of human subjects or objects

688
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,870
as we saw before definite to control to

689
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,690
mask or prevent their impact on the

690
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,330
dependent variable this controlled

691
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,370
variable I need to control them because

692
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,920
otherwise the variation of the dependent

693
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,210
variable is not linked only to the

694
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,230
variation of the independent one but may

695
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,860
be caused by the control by this other

696
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,900
variable okay and for example as it was

697
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,480
exemplified multiple time I have to test

698
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,010
on some code that is sufficiently

699
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,719
general and equivalent for all cases

700
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,190
let's see an example you've seen these

701
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,370
examples on what hidden in the in the

702
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,560
previous explanation but now let let us

703
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:49,000
see it more extensively so this is

704
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,980
example is an example of an experiment

705
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,989
of the experiment with just software

706
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,920
okay my goal is to understand which tool

707
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,560
is better for testing among two

708
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,980
available choices a and B okay these are

709
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,740
push button tools so I don't need to

710
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,120
consider the impact of the human in

711
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,390
using this tool okay the independent

712
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,340
variable we already saw it is the tool

713
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,300
is one part okay the treatments are also

714
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,370
straightforward so I have to lay and

715
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:25,240
should be one factor to treatment what

716
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,680
is the dependent variable

717
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,380
well my objective is to see which one is

718
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,440
better what do I mean by better okay

719
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,040
better is a quite vague concept is it

720
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,380
better in terms of speed where

721
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,020
in terms of bugs found I want to

722
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,080
consider both aspects so I in this case

723
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,690
I will have two dependent variable and I

724
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,180
define them as effectiveness and

725
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,360
efficiency so I compared the two tool in

726
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,150
terms of effectiveness that is how many

727
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,700
bugs do they found compared with the

728
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,890
total number of bugs that is present in

729
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,540
the culture because in this case I

730
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,500
assume that the two could not be able to

731
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,850
find some specific types of bugs and

732
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,440
efficiency that is related to the

733
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,840
running time and I define it as the

734
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,900
running time in relation to the number

735
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,150
of bugs that are found okay

736
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,910
or I could define it also in relation to

737
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,300
the length of the code this is just what

738
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,940
I decided I decided this these

739
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,610
quantities to me okay I decide what I'm

740
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,760
interested okay in this case I have two

741
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,320
these two dependent variable one

742
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,060
dependent variable and two treatments

743
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,230
okay now comes the difficult part I have

744
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,470
to identify the control variables what

745
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,360
and the question that I need to answer

746
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,180
is what can impact on effectiveness and

747
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,540
efficiency beside the type of tool well

748
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,450
the user well the user we said no it

749
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,670
does an impact because the tool is just

750
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,250
a push button to is fully automatic the

751
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,940
language of the code yes then probably

752
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,420
is it is too hard to consider all the

753
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,090
type of codes because it would need a

754
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,030
too large sample and in addition one of

755
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,970
the tool is able to test just for C so I

756
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,030
want to focus just on C code so you see

757
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,720
that I'm reducing my my scope of

758
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,890
interest somehow

759
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,900
before I was speaking about difference

760
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,450
between today and should be in finding

761
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:34,270
bugs but now I am saying that I am

762
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,940
focusing just on C code on a certain

763
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,240
type of language of course also another

764
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,190
variable to take into account is the

765
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,430
chosen code but the code shows and code

766
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,760
samples as we exemplified before so but

767
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,010
which are the attributes of the chosen

768
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,210
code that my

769
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,349
impact on the on the dependent variables

770
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:58,720
where might be the actual number of bugs

771
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,790
in the code model so I need some

772
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,160
sufficient very a sufficient variation

773
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,140
in terms of number of bugs in each

774
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,750
module that I'm testing the length of

775
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,060
the module as I said before the some

776
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,520
tool might be more effective if it's

777
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,609
working in shorter in shorter code so I

778
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:18,180
need two quite different and realistic

779
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,220
representation of different codes the

780
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,680
complexity of the of the code another

781
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,410
variable and the domain of the code why

782
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,730
because maybe depending on the domain I

783
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,570
a certain type of solutions that are

784
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,990
always adopted in a certain code and a

785
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,440
certain tool is more appropriate for the

786
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,170
features that the code in that domain

787
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,230
shows for example in a safety critical

788
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,990
environment I may not be allowed to use

789
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,720
global variables or I may not be allowed

790
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,839
to use pointers okay so a certain tool

791
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,230
may be more effective for the specific

792
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,770
quality specific feature of the safety

793
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,390
critical sector of the railway sector

794
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,730
for example while it may not work

795
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,849
properly if the C code is pointers and

796
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:16,210
has other characteristics of course you

797
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,400
can you can frame it in in different

798
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,970
ways you can look at at the different

799
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,680
and the different characteristics that

800
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,619
of the code or you can just say ok this

801
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:29,109
code is coming from a database of

802
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:31,030
railway code and this code is coming

803
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,640
from a database of I don't know

804
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,780
financial financial software okay so

805
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,670
these are all variables that you need to

806
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,740
take into account and justify when you

807
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,000
design your experiment ok so as I said I

808
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,830
have to create a code sample that has

809
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,180
sufficient variations

810
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,109
you know these variables and if I can do

811
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:55,359
very eight certain variable if I cannot

812
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,300
have a sufficient variation in a certain

813
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,010
variable I have to fix it like I did

814
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,400
with the C code or like I'm made to need

815
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,250
to do for the domain

816
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,080
okay and I need to make this choice

817
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,960
explicit as Italy mists my scope of

818
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,980
interest okay or in this case if the

819
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,160
theory independent it may limit your

820
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,670
scope or validity as well but in this

821
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,670
case you can say okay my theory I want

822
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,060
to refocus my theory only on this domain

823
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,130
and on this type of God okay

824
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,150
so this creates a boundary so the

825
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,190
controlled variable somewhat create a

826
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:39,800
boundary in your scope of interest okay

827
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,680
this is another example with software

828
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,390
and new months okay

829
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,020
and in this case like it is an example

830
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,290
that we considered also before I want to

831
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,780
see if the experience of the user

832
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,180
affects the effectiveness of a certain

833
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,910
tool okay the dependent variable in this

834
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,250
case is there is the one that we took

835
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,780
from last experiment so it's

836
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,330
defectiveness that is the number of bugs

837
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,330
found divided by the total number of

838
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,240
bugs in a certain piece of code so this

839
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,610
is the dependent variable that I want to

840
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,020
that I want to observe while they're

841
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,110
independent variable is is the

842
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:27,390
experience of the of the user but the

843
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,510
issue here is how can I measure this

844
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,700
experience while before the independent

845
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,140
variable was tool a or told B it was it

846
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,180
was quite clear straightforward we

847
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,180
didn't even think about measuring the

848
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,280
independent variable because it was a

849
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,370
binary variable basically so either you

850
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:50,430
use tool a or to B but in this case your

851
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,410
independent variable is the experience

852
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,040
and this is how to measure it I can

853
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,450
consider how can I measure the

854
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,520
experience of a user where I can

855
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,800
consider the years of experience is stay

856
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,440
in testing or I can ask what the years

857
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,780
of experience may tell you something but

858
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,870
they don't tell you how much how expert

859
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,000
is really that person so you may want to

860
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,880
ask the colleagues to judge a certain

861
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,540
person and to score this person

862
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,760
for for expertise in testing okay um so

863
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,100
in general it is better to select one

864
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,480
independent measure for the variable

865
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,910
okay so otherwise have many too many

866
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,280
treatments and might not find enough

867
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,240
participants

868
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,510
okay so better to select one of this

869
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,900
measure and justify but okay so let's

870
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,440
consider since it is easier to evaluate

871
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,590
although not necessarily perfect

872
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,810
I consider the years but sure that you

873
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,640
consider one year two years four years

874
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,780
five years so by single year or can I

875
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,710
can I group this year well if I decide

876
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,160
that I choose one two three four as

877
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,710
differences so I want to see how a

878
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,530
different of one year only can affect

879
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:13,200
the usage of a certain tool well this

880
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,750
may be difficult in several terms

881
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,210
because maybe the difference between two

882
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,770
and three years of experience is not

883
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,800
that much and in addition I need to find

884
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,900
enough people for the experiment so I

885
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,030
have to find many people who have just

886
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,860
one year many people who have just two

887
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,410
years many people who have three years

888
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,700
and so it may be very complicated again

889
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,850
as an experiment so probably is better

890
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:42,480
to separate to select some levels okay

891
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,510
how to select the level I have to do

892
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,550
some assumptions okay I have to take

893
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,590
some assumption take from the literature

894
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,590
or justify and defend my decision okay

895
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,550
there is no no silver bullet in here

896
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,120
okay and often you resort on other

897
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,580
studies that have done choice that is

898
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,290
similar to yours or you you have to

899
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,630
consider also common sense and your

900
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,630
knowledge for example I can decide for

901
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,950
two levels okay and in this level I have

902
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,560
two treatments one from zero to one

903
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,450
years novices and more than five years

904
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,100
experts okay so in this case I have

905
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,050
eliminated people that are in the

906
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,270
in-between ok there is a radical

907
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,220
difference of course between zero

908
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,410
- one year and more than five years okay

909
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,890
so this is evident and it is common

910
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,590
sense that I don't need to just justify

911
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,310
much okay so think about that of course

912
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,770
if you have people that have between two

913
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,200
and four years of experience and these

914
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,150
are a candidate for your experiment you

915
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,830
cannot use them you cannot see really

916
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,670
you cannot involve them okay

917
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,230
now it will identify the control

918
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,200
variables again the question is the

919
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,869
usual one what can impact on my outcomes

920
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:07,320
besides the experience here I don't have

921
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,359
the code I don't have the objects but I

922
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,480
have people so in this case I can have

923
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,160
age gender demographic variable so how

924
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,800
old am where do they come from where did

925
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,680
they study okay from which company are

926
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,430
they coming from and of course again the

927
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,550
code on which the tool is is applied

928
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,970
okay so the other previous variable so

929
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,369
you see that this experiment becomes

930
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:38,460
much more complicated I have to make

931
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,890
some choice I fix some some code base we

932
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,920
use the same for a subject and make sure

933
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,250
also in this case in say up also

934
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,780
interacting aspects make sure none of

935
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,650
them have shown I've seen the code in

936
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,380
advance because if for example if I have

937
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,619
to test certain code that I have already

938
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:05,190
tested I know already which are the bugs

939
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,070
so it's this is a this is affecting my

940
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,030
experiment so and but all but since in

941
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,210
some cases it may be the case that if

942
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,859
you if you're using code from a certain

943
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,690
company and the people are from the same

944
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,839
company it is possible that P those

945
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,760
people have seen that code okay and

946
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,180
these joopa dyes your experiments okay

947
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,820
and and then I control demographic

948
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,230
variables okay

949
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,900
select the rebels in a way that I have a

950
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,770
representative group of people without

951
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,380
imbalance in terms of age for example

952
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,330
otherwise if I cannot do that again I

953
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,480
restrict my scope of interest if I find

954
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,350
just people for example you know that

955
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,470
are all coming from the same company of

956
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,360
course the result of my experiment is

957
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,430
limited to the characteristic of the

958
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,370
specific company and may be extended to

959
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,170
companies with similar characteristics

960
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:09,320
and with similar trainings for example

961
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:14,040
ok so at the end this is my design and I

962
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,050
have a group with a comparable

963
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,990
experience novice or expert but

964
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,180
variations in terms of age gender and

965
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,640
other demographic aspects and I have a

966
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,530
code base so I have designed my

967
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,410
experience you see that here when I said

968
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,540
this requires a lot of creativity it

969
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,490
requires a lot of creativity you have to

970
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,790
think truly about what are your

971
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,700
constructs how to measure them how to

972
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,520
create your variables how to how to

973
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,540
measure the variables and you have to

974
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,430
consider different factors that are also

975
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,200
related to the possibilities that you

976
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,300
have because when you build a software

977
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,430
experiment a software engineering

978
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,570
experiment you you don't have infinite

979
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,940
resources if you had used it for example

980
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,340
if we are involved in developers and as

981
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,500
we said in the last lecture this

982
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,320
developer they have to do their work

983
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,300
their daily work so they cannot stay in

984
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,910
your experiment for two hours and there

985
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,460
are also fatigue and other factors that

986
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,160
may affect the experiment so is the is

987
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,480
really again optimizing between

988
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,740
different factors okay so what are the

989
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,530
pros and cons of controlled experiment

990
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,690
the main Pro the main the main advantage

991
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,340
physical experiment is that you're using

992
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,950
you are doing really real science ok

993
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,110
with the numbers because controlled

994
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:43,620
experiments are quantitative but up to

995
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,450
now you've never you didn't see any

996
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,660
number ok I didn't see any number so you

997
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,000
see that they are real science with

998
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,750
numbers real science means also dealing

999
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:58,420
a lot with the creativity with

1000
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,450
creating this constrained environment of

1001
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,430
the lab experiments of the control the

1002
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:07,809
spam okay and the great advantage is

1003
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:09,660
also that they can be applied to

1004
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,730
identifies identify cause effect

1005
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,130
relationship for specific well defined

1006
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:19,809
variables why as we said before the goal

1007
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:22,930
of the experiment is is to isolate the

1008
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,299
independent variable and control the

1009
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:28,059
other one so that the dependent variable

1010
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:30,519
is just dependent on variations

1011
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:33,609
variations of the independent one okay

1012
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:37,750
so this allows me to say when I change

1013
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,869
this I have a change in that and this

1014
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:43,119
change is not caused by anything else

1015
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,579
okay

1016
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:48,430
disadvantage there are many okay they

1017
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,140
are applicable only to well-defined

1018
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,720
problem in which you can actually define

1019
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,700
and isolate these variables as I said at

1020
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,950
the beginning if you have cases in which

1021
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,039
it is very complicated to to isolate the

1022
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,660
variable of interest because the

1023
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,390
contextual factors that may affect them

1024
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,539
are many and cannot be cannot be

1025
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:11,049
separated by by the measurement of the

1026
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,660
variable it is very hard to perform an

1027
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,170
experiment and they are hard

1028
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,390
also if you cannot simulate the right

1029
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,779
conditions in the rod so if the control

1030
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:24,789
confounding factors confounding

1031
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:28,509
variables may be too r2 to control so

1032
00:50:28,509 --> 00:50:31,980
the other variable that may impact the

1033
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,500
dependent variable and the other issues

1034
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,559
that the experiment is not realistic

1035
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,990
they behavior especially the behaviorist

1036
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,450
people of people in a in an experimental

1037
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:47,740
environment is very different from from

1038
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,619
their behavior in the in the real world

1039
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:52,960
of software development but the the

1040
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,009
obvious thing is that while in a lab the

1041
00:50:57,009 --> 00:50:58,750
experiment is carried out and in trust

1042
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:02,589
maybe one hour two hour maximum also

1043
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:05,289
because afterwards people get tired in

1044
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:07,299
software development you have eight

1045
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:09,490
hours of programming in a day or even

1046
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:12,099
more and in addition

1047
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:14,650
our dealing with the dynamic and

1048
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,749
ever-changing context with several

1049
00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:18,940
people coming to the developers of

1050
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,479
emails coming requests coming randomly

1051
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:27,849
so it is a much more complex reality

1052
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:31,269
that changes the behavior of the

1053
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:33,519
developer and that influences the

1054
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:36,609
behavior of the developer and of course

1055
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:39,549
recreating this complexity in the lab is

1056
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:42,519
not possible even just for the matter of

1057
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:45,119
time okay

1058
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,499
another issue is that if you do an

1059
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:49,569
experiment with software with human

1060
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:51,849
subject is desire to recruit the

1061
00:51:51,849 --> 00:51:54,279
subjects of course as I said develop

1062
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,619
yourself to develop and many managers

1063
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:00,789
need to manage so people have to work ok

1064
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:04,359
and recruiting people for example with

1065
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:07,359
expertise higher than 5 5 years it is

1066
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,719
complicated ok and very often in

1067
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:12,369
controlled experiment in software

1068
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:16,209
engineering students are used ok

1069
00:52:16,209 --> 00:52:21,609
other PhD students or or master students

1070
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:22,209
ok

1071
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:24,489
they are proxies of develop or

1072
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:28,180
real-world developers but of course in

1073
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,819
practice they can rarely mimic the

1074
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:33,130
degree of expertise ok

1075
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,349
they are used as proxies when you want

1076
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:37,599
to test for example a new methodology or

1077
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,069
a new tool that you that you are

1078
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:41,619
proposing for software engineer what

1079
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:45,249
software engineers but they use it and

1080
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:46,839
they are used because it's easier to

1081
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:50,019
involve students and it it is less

1082
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:51,999
costly to recruit them because you may

1083
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:54,640
pay them a little manual or a little

1084
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,239
reward

1085
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,160
I think that is always important to give

1086
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,229
in an experiment you always have to

1087
00:52:59,229 --> 00:53:04,839
think hey but this person why is she or

1088
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:08,259
he coming to the experiments either for

1089
00:53:08,259 --> 00:53:10,989
learning something either because this

1090
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:13,119
person is forced but you don't want that

1091
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,569
of course and or because you give them a

1092
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:21,400
kind of soft reward or because they

1093
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,739
learn something from from the experience

1094
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:25,119
ok

1095
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,940
so you have to clean it to carefully

1096
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,829
consider this when designing the

1097
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:32,950
experiment thinking about recruiting as

1098
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:35,740
we saw in the in our example the design

1099
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,680
is time consuming we spent a lot of time

1100
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,329
thinking about the experiments and can

1101
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:44,109
get very complicated very easily okay so

1102
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:46,839
if the core the thing becomes too

1103
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:49,690
complicated the actual control becomes

1104
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,490
difficult okay

1105
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,920
so better the recommendation she is that

1106
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,109
better to keep your experiments simple

1107
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:03,749
okay otherwise your control experiment

1108
00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:07,329
frequently risks to go out of control

1109
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:13,480
okay so now we pass two hypothesis

1110
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,749
testing but now first let's let's make

1111
00:54:16,749 --> 00:54:20,549
let's make a little break okay
