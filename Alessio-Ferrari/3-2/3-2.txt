this is the final part of the of this quite long introduction to to empirical methods in software engineering but it was quite long and quite verbose I admit but this is this is to give you first immersion which are the concept the terminology the ambiguity also in the terminology that you will encounter in the in this research and I think that it gives you enough information and enough concept to better understand the different strategies that you will learn because I may have taught you like controlled experiments but you need to see before what is that is that is not the entire word of course of empirical methods in software engineering and so I wanted to in this in these previous lectures to give you an idea of how large is this is the scope of this of this field okay this is a presentation basically about a paper a paper that was published by stollen Fitzgerald was published in 2018 and is the the ABC of software engineering research which basically is a taxonomy and survey of the different strategies that I use for software engineering research last time we spoke about data collection so one of the building block of a strategy now you saw that data collection is part of building the theory here you will see the strategies that can be used to build this theory okay first of all why they started with with this research because looking back at the history of empirical software engineering there was no universally accepted taxonomy for the research method so some paper for example this paper from glass was distinguishing between action research concept and analysis case study data analysis piece the experiment fees study meta-analysis literature review protocol analysis so a very long list simulation a very long list while other studies for example Joburg the third study controlled experiment service case studies an action research so there were different different names and also different meanings given to the to this concept so there was a need to create some order and at the same time I need to not to not to like let's say deny the truth of the previous work so instead of speaking about methods in this taxonomy we are speaking about strategies and strategies can use specific methods so you somehow hide the all the ambiguity in these names in the in the methods in the in the metals that are used and you simply call the the new things that the new class is strategies but it is a good comprehensive taxonomy ok so we we like to stick to it and we like to speak about our methods in in relation to the strategies that I will list first of all wire unifying framework because there wasn't a unifying framework and everyone was using a different terminology okay and this unified framework is using three main concepts okay is ABC because the these three main concepts are Octus behavior and context so a framework is what is a framework is a quite generic general word that identify somehow a model to explain some some concepts so a model of concepts and relationship you could see it as a theory that describes as an ontology somehow a theory that describes the the concept in a certain area okay the basic elements the building blocks of this theory of the framework are actors behavior and context so the actors in here are both human and technical so we are referring to software engineers but also developing artifacts to techniques prototypes of the system everything that can be identified as an object or an actor okay behavior behavior of all actors so system behavior but also software engineering behavior and context so context again like we were speaking before is the scope is the is the place in which these actors actually show their behavior and it includes into settings organizations of the project's development teams of the laboratory classroom meeting rooms so all the things that surround and that allows us to describe the the environment in which I want to measure the behavior of certain actors okay one key things is these three main dimensions that I am considering these three building blocks are three dimensions and they rip they are they allow me to to position my research strategy but it is important to notice that optimizing any study to achieve generally disability over actors so to cover as many actors as possible at the same time be able to precisely measure their behavior and considering a realistic context so close many all the actors possible very precisely measuring their behavior and considering a realistic context closer to reality is not possible okay it's not possible because we cannot maximize all these elements that are conflicting somehow why the intuition is simple as a in the distinction between a field study and an experiment what what is the main difference is that in an experiment I am in a lab so it's totally not realistic context and but I am able to measure very precisely some behavior in a realistic context so in a field study another type of study I can I have realism but the imprecise is very difficult because it is very difficult like for example in the field study that that I was giving that I was presenting before like we were using words for our constructs wearing measuring we weren't so precise in measuring our costs okay and at the same time generalizability over actors is very low because I'm considering a very specific company okay you have to consider you have to consider that performing basically something that is able to cover as many actors as possible like a survey for example and at the same time measuring the behavior in an exact way like an experiment and considering are considering a release in a realistic context like a field study it's not possible okay so depending on on what you want to on what you consider more relevant you consider a different you consider a different research strategy okay there is there are other two dimensions that we want to consider in this framework and then I will show you the framework and I'll obtrusiveness and generalizability okay absolutely even as indicate to what extent does a researcher in truth in the research sent the setting so simply make observation in an unobtrusive way so basically it means how much control do a head on the empirical settings in the case of an experiment an experiment is more exclusive in the sense that I I'm constraining I am making I am making modification to the reality okay to make it to make it to control the behavior of the actors at the same time one research like a field study is is less obtrusive because I'm not I'm not interfering and not transforming the reality for my research I stood as I'm studying the reality directly and the other dimension is generalizability generalizability means to each standard search findings are generalizable again a much of the scope of interest is covered given the color and scope of body this is the concept that we already met before but is used in this framework to represent the different to position the different research strategies this is the ABC framework from a higher perspective let's let's take some time to look at the diagram and then we will see the method the methods we have two dimensions that are the ones of obtrusiveness and generalizability and for more elusive methods like experiment and we have precise characterization of BA we use them when the precise characterization of behavior is relevant like for example experiment ok cases that are less general and less obtrusive I use them when a specific characterization of the context is relevant so the field study in which I want really to understand the things from the point of view or of a specific context ok if generalizability over actors in relevant I will use the strategies that are positioned in this either in this other corner okay this is as from this representation just have to remember that depending of what is relevant for you either behavior context or general ability over actors you choose the specific methods if you want to be precise on the behavior you choose a method that is up in in the diagram if you want in the diagram that you will see in the next slide okay if you want to have a more characterization of the context you need to choose some method that is on the right side of the diagram instead if you want generalizability over actors you will choose the the methods that are closer to the to the left bottom left corner okay remember always that behavior can be can be related to both people and softer because actors and actors can be people or softer so I can do like a will find here the both surveys but also in I will find here I mean in the in the corner about generalizability over actors I will find both methods that generalize over software systems and generalize over developers okay let's see the methods we have four quadrants okay that identify here is a more detailed representation of the diagrams that I gave before but as you can see you have the you have the ABC elements clearly positioned here but together with more information okay the name of the strategies and the type of settings okay let's look first at the setting so we have a natural settings the one of the field study contri settings the one of the experiment neutral setting the one of surveys sample studies and known empirical settings for mastering computer simulation so these are four different four different possibilities for the settings okay for the settings that I consider to remember this there are some metaphors that you can consider fifth studies are similar to the jungle okay studying in the wild okay in the jungle you don't control the jungle field experiments are most similar to a natural reserve so I have some freedom at the same time I have some control experimental simulations are similar to the flight simulator so I simulate reality ice try to simulate as much as possible a natural setting but still is simulated okay is not the reality in vitro experiment are the the paradigm for laboratory experiment so while English experiments can be experiment that don't involve humans for example laboratory experiment in software engineering very frequently we involve human but is a controlled setting is an artificial one okay while the flight simulator is the closer somehow to totally our reality try to mimic the reality in the in vitro experiment I isolate some variables from the reality in a very very clear way to identify a measure actors behavior then I have the judgment studies that are similar to the concept of cart room car trauma so I have several people deciding what is right and what is wrong basically and sample studies the paradigm the the metaphor is the referendum that is basically surveys so having having information from from different from different actors and finally non-empirical said jinx I have the mathematical model and the forecasting system mathematical model is a metaphor for a form art theory okay I am when I introduced a theory that is not derived from empirical verification but from literature for example okay and the computer simulation is more similar to a forecasting system okay is similar to the forecasting system for example for the weather okay or in which I am NOT basically it is different from from the experimental simulation because in here I try to use the system as a representation of reality but I don't have for example people there or I don't have actors there Ari I do we would see an example later on but I do a model a mathematical model of the reality and I perform a simulation through some stimuli but I'm not using actual realistic actors okay actual actors okay after actors so let's start from the natural settings field studies we studies we start I will always start in here with an example and then I will lease the characteristics this study is in this example this example of his study they wanted to investigate the impact of distributed teams so teams located in different geographical area in software development so is it better to have the people all together in the same building or having them in different in different parts of the world the setting was natural and the author of the study the first daughter spent seven months on site at one of the organization and he he studied the documents he made some observation and some interviews so he used multiple data collection methods and identified four problems and eight specific challenges so the idea is that you have a reality you go in a place you stay there for a certain amount of time and you you collect the data in different ways you see that this data collection method they both mix again people intensive and not people intensive techniques okay because documents study you don't need to involve the people but while interviews there is a high involvement of the people so they are they're quite demanding for the so you mix the different methods of data collection but the strategies field study okay this study so this was an example but in general the main characteristic is the net is the fact that the field study is natural you don't want to disturb the realism of the environment okay there is a minimal minimal intrusion and is always just oriented to facilitate that of election so for example an interview an interview is an intrusion okay in some in some way but at the same time it allows you to find some explanation for the things that you may observe it in the actual setting mainly you do feel study for exploratory purposes okay to understand what's going on to understand to better understand a certain environment okay not for doing precise measurements and predictions okay and the typical methods that you use are case studies we will see this is another term that is somewhat everywhere and it means it may mean several thing but basically a case study is rigorous let's say not Cerrillos but a Strad research methodology applied when you do any study in companies okay it's nog refutes additional study this can be can be considered all old names or research methods that have some overlap in one with the other but think that you are generally using qualitative data collection methods so interviews fit notes from observation a covered document you could include also quantitative data if they are needed for your research goal for example about cost about time but you may need to to ask the company also for for death it is not always easy okay easy one thing that is is not mentioned so frequently is that when you do field studies we will speak about it when when we look better into qualitative studies but when doofus study you have always to consider that many of the things that you find in a company you may not be allowed to disclose so this is a this is a big problem that frequently students PhD students encounter when they when they get in contact with a company and they do a study maybe they even they did even contribute to the company but then they cannot publish the work there are problem in the thesis and maybe they are PhD students and they they need to publish okay so you you need to clarify always from the beginning what you can publish and what you cannot so that what you cannot publish you observe you try to get the information but you tend to focus on what you can make public okay because otherwise the science and the field does not advance because you may know it as we taught history told in some lectures but by the other people don't know so it is important that you makes it explicit the limitation in main limitation is the lack of generalizability so you study a company's not generalizable you know they don't have control over the events and you don't have so much precision in the measurement also because you're using mostly a qualitative data in essence the idea is that you don't manipulate the reality and you are using a realist assent settings for the specific system and context that you want to study so you are focused on a specific context it is not appropriate for investigating statistical relationship or manipulate variable and it is not appropriate for findings that you want to hold for a larger population so when do you need to use it when you are in an exploratory phase you don't want to intervene too much on the environment on the settings because you don't want to make assumptions beforehand since you are still in exploratory phase you don't want to manipulate the reality okay and you are willing to gather some apps at eye level information that may allow you later to define more detailed hypothesis and more detailed the research question but at this stage you want just to understand what's going on okay I understand what's going on at least it concepts illicit proposition that are quite high level so the example that I gave you before was a field study okay the example I give you in the in the previous our second thing is still in natural settings is the field experiment the natural reserve so I've passing from the jungle to the naturalist reserve the goal in the in this case the purpose for this example is hold a start for example is to identify a cost-effective way to avoid software defects so they wanted to understand to understand which was the most cost effective way they consider this setting which was a company and they introduced a researcher that was performing some collaboration in the company using new real products so the products of the company to evaluate new approaches so to perform avoiding software defects so was developing basically new techniques within the company they procedure was we can call it improving case study here is called action research also this is a term from the literature but it is frequently encountered basically in our lecture we will call them improving text on okay a case study so a study in a company that is aimed at improving the process okay and you have a person or researcher that participate and contribute with this with this transformation and at the same time measure the effect of this transformation so you have a defect report for example the data that is collecting in this case our defects report that I spent usability issue time nests of the project product sets you see that in this case compared to three studies you already have some more detailed information you are closer to measures okay and they they found that certain techniques were beneficial while other were time consuming and did not avoid the facts so they were doing some experimental experiment they were doing measures but in a real environment so many variables were not controlled and you couldn't for example randomly sample subjects you were in a specific company with specific software with the specific characteristics and you are introducing new approaches and moreover you are present there and you by us unavoidably the the research ok still it is valuable because it helps the company so in this case again the setting is natural is pre-existing but there is some level of intrusion because you are transforming you are introducing some new element in the setting in this case you are experimenting with with new technologies ok the purposes can be to investigate evaluate compare techniques so there is there may be also a level of exploratory analysis part is more advanced of course because in this case you are you want to to transform that reality in a field study you studied say you analyze it in this case you improve it to transform it typical methods in that case a deposit experiment the action research and again action research see me is a synonym for improving case study and you may use both qualitative and quantitative data as I saw as I said you have my ever you may have a part that is more more qualitative more related to exploratory aspects and one is more quantitative and again limited generalizability and there are co-founded facts as I said you are present there you have a bias you are participating to the environment you are in the environment is of course full of variables that you don't control okay so you cannot measure the behavior precisely that's why in the diagram feed experiments are positioned on the right side so very specific for a context but but but generalization over actors is more limited okay so they this this type of study useful when you want to transform the you want to transform a certain setting and it can be potentially very costly okay and to set up him and evaluate and again as I said before results are not generalizable okay so these are the two type of the two type of okay study let's go let's go down this way in which you do either a field experiment or a field study but still we are speaking about case studies okay also experimental simulation may fit into case studies let's see an example here we are dealing with contrast setting so what you seen now is when I maximize the realism of the context okay now I maximize the precious the precision of measurements of actors behavior okay in a controlled setting this is an example that the purpose is to understand how developers perceive the testing team so I have a company and I want to understand his duties developer like the testing team or like they have some form of conflict with them which this conflicts okay and the setting is contrived because in this in this experiment because I have built the simulation environment in the company in which I define previously the experiment the experiment a stimuli so I define the software that has to be written by the developers and the checks to be performed by the tests so they are doing a sort of role-playing activity in their company themselves so I asked the software developers to develop a certain software accordingly discourse of course Limited is not like the entire software is ax is a it is a sample is a ISM is similar to what you would do with a lab experiment but in a specific research environment so a specific software team and a specific testing team specifically development in a specific testing team okay and I have defined the day procedure okay watch what would be and the procedure for developing the software and also the checks to be performed by the testers so developed developed code to test the test and give feedback during the meeting and the researcher in this case observed the impressions okay and they found that there were several defensive reactions interesting by the developer so typically the testing team is saying hey Hugh you made this mistake and the developer of course react by saying by providing justification okay so this is an example of an experimental simulation it's like the flight simulator in the sense that I'm recreating the reality but at the same time as much as possible but at the same time is not the reality like Indians rather serve okay the code the setting is contrived is in vitro is not the natural is not the realistic one okay the goal is is to have a controller setting that resembles the real world so a concrete class or settings as closely as possible and the methods are role-playing games as I was saying over simulation and management games so this this type of approaches in which you involve people in a in a role-playing activity basically like the one exemplified and you collect data that can be related qualitative and quantitative at the same time for example in the main example meeting you have you may have quantitative data related to the time people are speaking or qualitative data related to the type of reactions that people may have the inner inherent limitation is that again generalizability is reduced because is the the setting is designed for a specific type of settings so I have the people from the company and they are real realism is at the same time reduced to because the setting is somewhat artificial so these are similar to rub experiment but quite context specific okay just okay and in essence basically here that the characteristic is that the controvert settings simulate a specific class of real-world system and to try to resembles reality but is not reality okay of course it allows to observe a more natural behavior than lab experiments okay and but the the measures are more precise than them field experiments but less precise than the natural experiments okay and it is important to consider that the behavioral others may reflect that that they have in natural settings because they may reflect the relationship that they have but consequences of or actors may like realism and this may affect their behavior indeed like for example you may have this meeting between developers and testers but you may you may also have you you may also not see all the possible aspects because after this this role-playing activity there is no for example refactoring got the code so there may have written errors in the code and the testers complain but then they are not forced actually to modify the code so their reaction may be different from the one that they have in the reality okay now let's see laboratory expand give me so in vitro experiments in this example you are you want to investigate the Apothic is there a certain code inspection method a is more effective than another method be typical experiment okay the setting is contrived so we are dealing with contrived settings as as for the simulation okay so and I used graduate students so this is another sort of difference and it's quite typical of software engineering experiments when you have to deal with people and want to do an experiment there are very few cases in which you are sampling from a real community of developers you always you often use graduate students as a proxy okay and of course it's different experience is different but they have demonstrated that many aspects that are the interest for empirical software engineering can be identified also with with software engineering or computer science students instead of real developers ok in this case they measure the effect of the special methods and to consider four variables including for detection rate so they wanted to use this inspection inspection difference by inspection means that you read the code and you check for you don't run it and you check for positive the effects of the code by reviewing it okay is a form of quality assessment of the source code okay and they consider also fault detection rate of the different methods these methods are normally a checklist okay did I find this type of problem or not how many of this problem did I find so this is typically the strategy for inspection to give you more more information about the context they found that the specs on method a is more affected an inspection method B why because the full detection rate is higher for a given specific document and well-defined well-defined the contrived settings so in this case I the key thing is that in laboratory experiments I control all the measured variable I have a full degree of control okay I can measure with a very good precision the relationship between the variables so if I use a certain method what I can measure what is the fault detection rate in a certain precise manner if I use another melt method and I keep all the other variables fixed I can measure the for detection rate in a precise way and I can compare the two methods in terms of fold detection capability they I can also with fiddle with the laboratory experiment I can also establish the causality between variables because if I isolate two variables and I see that in a certain moment variable variable a is is introduced or is activated and variable B is activated later on always and there are no other confounding variables I can see that I can establish that there is a form of Kazu a causality between a and B so a is causing it's causing beat because it always happened before B and they always happen in the same occasions okay typical typical methods of data here is the randomized controlled experiment and Norma use quantitative data okay the limitation is that it is artificial so I focus on very specific variables but I'm not representing the reality in which many variables interfere for example in that X in the example of the of the two methods for for inspection for sure I will use some representative documents to be inspected okay these are no and these can be representative of reality but they are not the reality in the reality I may have longer documents much more variability and an additional element I'm using students and other experts so there are some inherent limitation that are related to the fact that the setting is artificial okay also the time the time that I can dedicate in a field study is different from the one that I can dedicate in an experiment okay and these are oriented to for studying the essence so for studying very very precise thing and the idea is that we optimize internal validity of the cost of the standard validity okay we are oriented to be sure that the internal validity aspects are covered okay laboratory experiments that are these hinges lights that you see you see the essence again so control settings precise measurement and this this these type of studies are more artificial artificial than experimental simulation okay while in experimental simulation you try to mimic a real environment real context somehow in a laboratory experiment you try to abstract from specific context okay this is a missus Pam and now let's look at the methods that are related to a neutral setting so I'm not constraining I'm not in the natural one but I am in a neutral setting let's do some example that is easier first one is judgment studies there are as I said similar to courtrooms for example want to evaluate 12 practices based on the feedback of team managers so 12 software development practices different software development practice and I have the the feedback by by people because coming from different companies okay the setting is never neutral because I consider a meeting room I call my subjects and allow them to sit around the table and discuss okay I use I take ten managers from different seven different companies and I select them on purpose so I select them based on their experience of the different practices okay based on their interests based on the respective so they are champions somehow they are representative of the people who know about a certain topic okay and the the output is a conceptual framework of defecting benefits for the 12 practices okay so I select in this case the people that do the judgment the setting is neutral so we want to nullify the context we are speaking about general cases so it is important that I selected people from different companies okay because I want to I want to take as more context I want to cover as more context as possible okay I want to generalize to generalize independently of the context okay relation reaction so the can be then how do you say the reaction of the people can be related to some steaming notes okay I may have some specific questions so I don't leave them free to discuss it can be it can be guided by some specific question or I can involve them in using a specific methodology and assessing whether which is their judgment okay in this case the goal is to elicit information from subjects for four subject that are knowledgeable a certain about a certain topic when do I use this I use this when a certain topic is very complicated and is broad and I cannot find a large amount of people that can answer my questions for example if I have to study the effectiveness of for example formal methods that are mathematically based techniques to model and develop software okay people who are experts in industrial application of these methods and not so many okay and I have to select precisely because if I do a questionnaire I can gather some relevant information about that it don't go deep into the technicalities and the aspect that may be relevant to understand benefits and challenges okay so you do this study when the knowledge required is extensive and few people know it typical methods are Delphis studies that we studies is basically similarly similar to two brainstorming but it's not similar to based on let's say you have different subjects they give a judgement and then independently so for example you decide this this method how good it is and in a paper the different the different experts they evaluate and then they share with the their evaluation and the other can discuss can give feedback on this evaluation okay there are multiple stages to reach a form of agreement between experts okay multiple stages of personal and collective judgment you can use also follows group brainstorming the etc okay normally you collect qualitative data you can also collect quantitative data but is more more unlikely let's say mmm responses are general so they are not related to specific context okay they are less generalizable also than surveys because you don't do representative sampling you just select 10 people for example so it you're not doing Ramadhan something you are selecting specific specific people and you don't have like an extensive number of answers and you cannot do frequency analysis okay the same time you have less control and precision than the lab experiments okay because but also your goal is is mostly not quantitative is mostly qualitative and so it is it is an in limitation but you wouldn't apply a judgment study in a case in which control and precision is strictly relevant here you want to hear the opinion okay this facilitates the study of currently facilitates the the elimination basic the neutralization of the context and compared to service you can you can ask very complex question have deep interactions okay and you can elicit more information so the main issue is that that the absence of a neutral setting as we were saying before there is there is a problem while you while you tend to be more general of course and you ask general question or firing and you are not observing the phenomenon you are just asked asking impressions okay this is a relevant thing sample studies so sample studies are also for in a neutral setting and this is a in this example you have a web-based questioner to investigate a set of practice of requirements engineering in industry they had 22 questions they got participants from internet and they got is almost 200 responses from a population of 1500 so they asked many people but they received this designed these answers and they they had some findings about the different type of life called model the requirements engineering techniques that they were using so some statistical information they made a survey ok in this case again the setting is natural is neutral and but the issue is that the researcher has to deal with whatever data is collected so you cannot ask clarification you cannot ask clarification to the answer so you have to be very very precise in your questions and I will give you a lecture actually on building surveys that that a feeling a survey is normally quite easy but building a survey that it's easy to feel by many people is extremely difficult especially in a so diverse environment like software engineering ok the purpose is usually to study the distribution of some characteristics so evaluating some frequency of about the opinion on usage or the actual practice of usage of a certain technique for example and the methods depend of course on the type of actor that you consider if your actor you Mon you norm I do a survey which is a questioner if you if the the sub if the actor is software you use software repository mining so mining software repositories the the techniques that I was explaining you last time okay and if we have time we will do a lecture on that normally you you use quantitative data okay but you can avoid so qualitative one but these sample studies are oriented for mostly frequencies okay because as easier because of course a question are intuitively a questionnaire in which you have just checked boxes instead of free text boxes which is easier to analyze in terms of frequency okay because the free text box is as to be analyzed analyzed like interviews but you don't have the possibility to ask clarifications okay limitation is that you are limited to a set of questions so you cannot ask too many too many things so your you gather knowledge about a certain area a limited area let's say and you don't have the interaction this is very important I mentioned again you cannot clarify okay and you cannot yeah you can manipulate variable but you only correlate okay the essence is that the the sample studies allow the maximum potential to generalize the findings to a wider population so I reach more people and so my findings may be valid for a larger population with respect to what I find with a with a case studies and is an obtrusive so I don't enter I don't transform the setting okay the valuation consideration is that question tend to be simple and there's no comparison interaction and you may asked question about ready real context but they are just opinion okay again like the judgment studies you are there you have no reference to a realistic context for my theory is these are the the final the final types for my theory is is a way of basically building the the analogous old mathematical models but in software engineering so in this example we have a study in which the authors wanted to develop an understanding of the role of creativity in requirements engineering re is requirements engineering okay so what is the impact of creativity in in identifying new requirements for new system intuitively this is relevant for example because if without creativity the iPhone couldn't be invented okay or the iPad or the all the things that that you all the technical thing all the new software that you find market software is is based on some stimulus that come yes from customers but mostly from the creativity of some people that are observable to observe the reality and come out with new with new smart solutions okay this is a oppan a parenthesis in this because software when we speak for example about requirements elicitation we speak about an activity of interacting with a customer for example the hospital that is asking me to develop some software so creativity here I have some creativity but it's limited somehow because I have to know what is asking okay on the other hand if I am developing a new creature a new software for the market okay okay and invent I have to resort a lot on creativity because my main my main goal is to introduce a product that is new so no one not even they uses the potential user have thought about that product so creativity is key okay and in the middle there are different shades of course because you may have previously developed off for the market like I don't know Microsoft Windows for example and you may have people that that that give you feedback on on the usage of the product both direct feedback with some user studies or direct feedback for example when it crashes you send the crashing information to the to the developers okay and so you can improve your soft so let's close the parentheses but this was this is this is a study for understanding their own creativity requirements engineering so in this case 0 empirical observation no salvation but I do I research from the literature okay I derived this framework by checking creativity literature and requirements engineering creativity literature so I derive a format theory by doing systematic literature review basically and the output is a theoretical framework that offer the researcher the basis to incorporate creativity in the in the requirements engineering process okay this is never this this this formal theory is not tested empirically so somewhat Yahoo SIA is a known empirical study at the same time you are dealing with the literature so you are dealing with something that exists in the world and that can be a guide for further empirical studies because once you have a theory you can see if it works so you can try to follow this theory and see if it actually allows to improve your software development process for example so the setting is known imperial as I was saying the setting is an office or a library and the goal normally is to create a framework a conceptualization and to identify relations and explanation relation among concept and explanation for a wide range of contexts so for my theory in software engineering is usually is usually a framework that tries to cover as many as many cases as possible that's why you also resort from available literature for example you may have found for my theory is related also to that process of abduction that I was speaking about ok for example I have found the several studies that say a certain thing they say that for example the involvement of user in the in the first stages of the system development so in first in requirements and the requirements phase is a positive and I need to check in which fields these studies have been applied so I can build I can group this they could the conclusion of these studies and build a higher level theory abduct a theory so in this case the abduction is related to the creation of a higher level theory that merges and compulsives different theories that have been developed through empirical research ok still the theory needs to be needs to be verified ok because I'm doing a step forward I'm abstracting I'm transfer I'm introducing new con ok the problem is that there's no realism and I'm not manipulating variable measurement so there are several limitations of course formal theory is always a stage of empirical research but a very important one because once you have a formal theory that is solid you can refer to it to predict and to do everything that you need in your software process this is the most generic thing so for the for covering all the classes of populations is the most general tend to generalize maximum generalization of her over actors and it may be useful as I was saying for future empirical studies and finally we have computer simulations computer simulations are similar to format theory and at the same time as similar to fish study in which sense in the sense that I let's see this example first the sample is to investigate the bottleneck so problems an overload in the testing processes of a company ok the software company it was implemented a discrete event simulation so they tried to to introduce some artificial variables and they they built a computer program that was simulating the fundamental variables and fundamental interactions in a real process okay some what you could think about Petri net if you have confidence with that or so form of a computerized diagram in which you can evaluate how the process goes and which which are the bottlenecks of course this is not the reality but it's a simulation scenario that mimics the reality considering what me as a researcher I considered I consider relevant ok I do some form of instruction i operationalize somewhat the theory in a computer system they saw by running several several experimentation with it with the simulator that they to avoid congestion in testing they need to include increase the number of staff and increase the number of interactions with the development team of course if I didn't consider some very relevant variable this would not be noticed in most production environment so it is important that is very close to the real environment I didn't experiment with real people I didn't involve people at all so it is it is a way for doing estimation without requiring strong people intervention the the setting is known empirical in silico because it's in home puter and everything is specified in the simulation the fact that I'm using the model so I'm basically representing variables and relationship in an artificial simplified model it allows me to evaluate many many scenarios so multiple scenarios and that cannot be tested with the same time within the same timeframe and effort in the reality okay and normally you do you do this based on previous empirical studies and you Colette normally quantity' of course quantitative quantitative data but considering no empirical data is gathered you are gathering data that are estimates of what what is the reality the generalizability is it's lower than a formal theory for example because in my simulation I tend to represent a specific class of system so I want to understand what are the peculiarities of a certain calm okay so in essence the key thing here is being able to simulate many scenarios and the humane issue is that the empirical behavior after implicit behavior is not observed and to build this type of models is not is not so easy because in software engineering theories are limited at the same time I also I have little support for building models at the same time the contexts are all different and they have many different variables so it's difficult actually to create a model realistic model okay so that can be seen related so this method I'm not so frequent here you see which methods are more frequent in software engineering and which methods are less frequent so in vitro experiment experiments are very frequent okay same time feed experiment and fish study are frequent so the case studies experiment case studies surveys are quite frequent not not as frequent as in this experiment and as case studies but quite frequent surveys and especially in mining software repositories now so referendum sample studies are frequent conceptualization mathematical model if we include systematic literature reviews and systematic mapping studies so studies that gather literature on a certain topic and try to frame conceptualization of this literature these are frequent in software engineering okay if you are dealing with the more formal theory in the sense of mathematical models of behavior that can be afterwards computer simulated like a forecasting system this these are not frequent at all okay same thing for the fly field simulator not frequent at all because you normally if you have access to the rat rod setting you normally use a typical case study with the field experiment okay because in the field experiment you can actually help the people you can add the people in the company with a experimental simulation the one that profits is just a researcher so it's very hard that the company allows you to perform an experimental simulation the courtroom are also quite rare because I would say that it is it is hard to find valid output because you are really relating with experts only and there are not so many guidelines for performing this this type of this type of studies so they are not so frequent in software engineering we tend to rely more on and and it is also historically I think because before field studies and experiments were just experience reports let's say so there was a lot of opinion of the researcher now the research is heading towards a more objective although slightly biased research approach judgment studies are inherently opinion okay inherently opinion and of a limited number of people so they they are not so frequent also because they are considered more float although in some cases you have no way but to use a judgement study because as I said before few people are few people know about certain topic for example then that is anyway relevant for the software engineering field so this is a this is an overview of the methods we will see in our case you will see in vitro experiment so laboratory experiment okay we will see case studies in the form of field experiments and field studies and in particular for field studies we will see qualitative qualitative we will research refer to these studies when we speak about qualitative research methods because qualitative research method where you will very frequently go together with these field studies that are more exploratory okay we will not we will see mathematical model in the sensor we will see systematic literature reviews and we will see sample studies because both from for sure from the point of view of people so with the surveys and for from the point of view from the point of view of people but also from the point of view of software as actors so with - software repositories if we have sufficient time for this for this content so as a to conclude this very long introduction I would like to give you just a few a few information for a few hint a few reflections that are taken from Daniel mandus which is who is a colleague and I invite you also to look at his life I took inspiration from his lied also for that the link is there in the slide for for the part on building theories in software engineering so if you want to know more especially about about concept philosophical context such as reductionism structural constructivist and positivist approaches and all these philosophical terms you can refer and have an even larger view of of the theory building you can refer to to the to his own slides okay that are public the thing that you should remember and that we can consider as commandments of software engineering is that of empirical software engineering is that there is no such thing as an absolute or universal truth so truth is always relative ok everything I apply one of the methodology as I said I lose some information either on the behavior on the actor or on the context so there is no way in empirical studies to find a universal truth ok the value of a scientific theory that is derived through one of these strategies depends on the ability to stand criticism by the research community so peers have to evaluate to what extent you are convincing ok what extent your studies convincing ok the contribution to the body of knowledge so how much you are actually contributing in in terms of existing evidence does your does your tribution actually say something new and sufficiently sufficiently different from what he was told before or is sufficiently confirming confirming to a certain degree what was intuitively shown before for example and ability to solve the problem so I mean so the problem is fundamental so the value is related to how much also it is useful your research your theory is useful ok this is as I said before I want to repeat it theory building is alone than ever as I said as I shown there may be a step inductive step then 

afterwards a deductive step followed by other deductive steps ok you may have different iterations before covering the scope of interest of your theory ok and this iteration are also within the study themselves as I said when we were speaking about research questions sometime ago your research questions becomes stable just at the end of the research ok because the data it will show you something new always and you will have to iterate even in your own research so iteration means that you have iteration between different stages from exploratory to explanatory but at the same time you have also iteration within your own research to change to make linear to show as linear something that actually was developed through different iteration and again it is important to consider the acceptance by peer so research communities are key in here for both acceptance and criticism of your own research not just evidence but also evidence that can be communicated and it is in and it is argued in a in a clear way so that to other peers other people that are competent in the field can judge okay other other the other come commandant somehow are be skeptical and open at the same time of course this is this is also key do not consider that something that is some statement that you find in the book 

or that I communicate to you is true and is true forever okay criticize it because things change and both in the rigour in which research is performed and both in the software engineering reality the way we were building software ten years ago 20 years ago is not the same way that we are approaching the software problem today okay and be also open at the same time skeptical but also open to to the new arguments that are expressed because this is not a process in which we are building theories and it is like a pyramid that remains there okay theories are transformed transformed with time because theories try to represent a reality that is ever-changing okay fundamental to consider strengths of limitation of the single research strategies that that we listed before so again no silver bullets no strategy that can can optimize for the different elements and consider the validity analyze always the validity of your study and be self-aware also of the bias to that you may introduce in your research for example here I can give you an anecdote eval and an ethical aspect is not related to software engineering but to is related to the use of LSD in oxirane easily of LSD to cure some mental disorders okay and also to enhance the capability of of the people to have the some some form of some form of mystical experience this these people that were doing experiment with this with this product Allison origin product basically they wanted they they were explaining before before doing the test with with the people they spent like one hour or two with them explaining them 

what would be the trip like okay and they asked him somehow questions to them that were already driving them towards a certain type of mystical experience so the experimenter was actually oriented to to have a good experiment a sound experiment with the randomized trials people selected randomly but at the same time the way that he was that he was training the people for the experience was biasing them towards the mystical experience so they were speaking already about mystical aspects one hour before and of course this had an influence on the way they experienced the actual trick with the LSD okay if they were speaking about for example try of tragic aspects of the usage of the drug then the experience would have been probably a bad trip with something completely different okay I'm giving you this you this as an example because it is showing the good faith of the researcher in creating in demonstrating that something is useful because for these people using this this drug was actually seen as a new medicine for for for for the people okay but at the same time they so they they wanted to they meant goods they want to do the experiment in a good way but at the same time they were introducing some areas okay finally I appreciate the value of all research processing methods you've seen a variety very large variety new results so also is if some theory that is developed it doesn't work so if you if you happen to review a paper or to read about an experiment that failed don't criticize that much because knowing that something does a work is knowing okay and appreciate replication study so if someone did the same thing like another one this still has value okay because progress and knowledge come through repetition and one key element that I want equality of research was testability 

if I can replicate a study it means that is testable and if it's testable it means that I can if I reproduce the same results these rain firts a lot the study because it takes away a lot of the possible bias that may be introduced and a lot of variable confounding variables that may be introduced in the earlier study so replication studies are very important and again be an active part of something bigger in your studies if you decide if you if you go ahead with studying these topics you will be able to cover in your career just few steps of a certain theory and just contribute to some bricks of the of the old some some elements of the old knowledge but so you will need to rely on other people and it is important that you clearly communicate your results okay
