1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
okay so today we will we closed our

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,730
introductory part of the course and then

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,269
we will go to the actual meet with with

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,580
a different with the different methods

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,269
for for doing for doing research in

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,890
empirical software engineering okay

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,720
today we will speak about building

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,000
theories in software engineering and we

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,730
will speak about also which are the

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,840
different strategies for for performing

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,340
empirical studies in software

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,740
engineering last time we saw data

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,410
collection methods which is just a part

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,579
of the whole research process okay today

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,489
we will see the what surrounds what

16
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,649
which are the strategies that are using

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,440
also those data collection method but

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,340
first let's start with the moral of a

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,610
philosophical part let's say of the

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,129
discourse that is related to how to to a

21
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,170
general to a general view or how we

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,250
build the theories in a in our in our

23
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,400
field so first of all what is the theory ?


24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,409
a theory is a term that we already used

  25
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,220
both in this course and you ofcourse
26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,670
also know I know yourself and you use it

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,000
yourself but what is exactly let's read

"A statement about the existence of some pattern in the entities that belong to a certain context"

"The boundary of the context determines the scope of
applicability of the theory (e.g., all the people in a certain company vs all the C developers of the world)"
28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,880
this leidos in this case a theory is a

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,340
statement about the existence of some

30
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,040
pattern in the entities that belong to a certain context 

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,890
so basically the key here is "pattern" 

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,759
okay ? every time there is a "regularity" in the world or

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,540
or in a like in my in my area of interest okay ? 


35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,500
I can build the theory and the theory is about entities

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,259
 entities here is a generic word

37
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,470
that can be translated also as

38
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,540
observable phenomena and includes both

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,780
objects or static elements and "events" 

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,840
so dynamic elements and that belong to a

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,390
certain context it is important to

42
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,310
consider that there are regularities

43
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,220
about entities and they are in a certain

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,348
context why is important to consider the

45
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,510
context because the context is the

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,500
boundary

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,260
the scope of applicability of the theory

48
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,850
for example I can build a theory that is

49
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,070
related to the context of all the people

50
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,530
in a certain company or I can be the

51
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,600
theory that is related to all the C

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,060
developers of the world so the context

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,520
the boundary to which the theory is

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,400
referred is different okay so remember

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,880
remember this thing theory is associated

56
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,090
to patterns which end two entities and

57
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,890
two specific contexts I considering this

58
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,570
I can have different levels of

59
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,940
sophistication of a theory and it

60
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,820
depends on how much abstract are these

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,400
entities considered so how much abtract

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,680
are the objects and the events that are

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,750
considered they observable phenomena

64
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:26,320 
okay also means how far are them from direct measurable observation so how far are them from thing that I can evaluate with numbers, okay? 
here I made three different example that gives you an idea of what is the  different level of sophistication of a theory. 

71
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,269
so we have

72
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,090
low level of sophistication for example

73
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,250
this is the theory ninety percent of

74
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,959
force are found in functions that are

75
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,920
longer than 1000 1000 line of code okay

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,380
here you see that this is a theory

77
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,500
because it's a pattern it's some form of

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,360
regularity in the world because you can

79
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,820
say that 90% of force is something that

80
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,940
happened like in for example in the

81
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,239
context of a company and or in the

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,730
context of all the C functions okay here

83
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,640
come again the contest but still it is a

84
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,640
regularity that that I'm stating a

85
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,780
pattern somehow that I I want to frame

86
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,870
with this theory and in this case it's

87
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,350
quite easy to be verified precisely it

88
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,299
can verify to verify quite precisely

89
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,700
because I'm dealing with frequencies and

90
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,589
I'm dealing with real objects okay and

91
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,750
the measurement that I take are quite

92
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,080
are close to

93
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,970
close to the observation so the lines of

94
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,450
code is something that I can count

95
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,850
easily okay and once I have given the

96
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,430
definition of a fault or saw fault can

97
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,850
be identified quite easily okay then I

98
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,370
have another level of sophistication the

99
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,270
desire for example consider this theory

100
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,230
requirements defects can be classified

101
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,930
into unclarity incompleteness and in

102
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,690
correctness first of all here I see that

103
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,820
I don't have numbers okay and this is

104
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,550
the first first issue that makes me

105
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,580
think okay is already it's already more

106
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,490
abstract than the other one okay ? here I

107
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,650
need first of all some precise

108
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,660
definition of the three classes so what

109
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,240
does the unclarity means what does

110
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,460
incompleteness mean what are in

111
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,940
correctness me okay and I have to assess

112
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,060
that all the existing defects okay all

113
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,830
the deficient existing defects in my

114
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,010
context always can be linked to one of

115
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,780
the classes so it can be if I take a

116
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,570
random defect it can be classified if

117
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,300
one of these three classes are the other

118
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,400
is unclear or incomplete or incorrect

119
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,750
okay and not only this but I have to

120
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,340
assess that every person that has to

121
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,270
link the defect to one of this class

122
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,790
actually classify the defect in the same

123
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,120
way or in similar way the verification

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,630
of this theory is much more complicated

125
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,480
okay with respect to the with respect to

126
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,680
the other case okay because I I need to

127
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,870
I need to introduce all these other

128
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,810
definitions and context and evaluation

129
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,390
that are less accurate less and

130
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,150
unavoidable rest less precise okay and

131
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,270
then I have I can have even higher level

132
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,930
of sophistication for example but still

133
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,330
speak about the theory and something

134
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,360
that can I can assess and evaluate for

135
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,850
example this case if the team leader is

136
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,190
not sub confidence self-confident

137
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,690
developers loose trust

138
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,200
loose trust first of all here is not

139
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,300
just it's not just dealing with

140
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,710
something that is referred

141
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,140
to an object requirement okay it's

142
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,610
referred to to to a quality of a person

143
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,150
so self-confidence trusts okay what is

144
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,270
self confidence how can evaluate it what

145
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,780
is trust I can how can I estimate this

146
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,720
okay verification of this concept that

147
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,060
are you understand very abstract much

148
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,220
more abstract than the other one that we

149
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,320
were speaking about up to now requires

150
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,540
unavoidably implies that verification of

151
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,080
this theory is much more difficult okay

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,200
and especially precise verification of

153
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,450
this theory is much more difficult okay

154
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,850
in software engineering you find all

155
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,130
these different type of feelings okay

156
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,540
software engineering you have to

157
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,910
consider that you will meet all these

158
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,760
different granularities okay and this is

159
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,520
also the interesting thing because you

160
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,360
deal with different different as I told

161
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
in the first lecture

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,320
you do with a social aspect technical

163
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,600
aspect human aspect emotional aspect but

164
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,720
also numeric and and and software

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,610
related in software related aspect okay

166
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,340
so this was what a theory is what a

167
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,060
theory does a theory can do? 

168
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:14,760
this mainly these five things so 
1. it can describe 
2. it can explain
3. it can predict
4. it can do explanation and prediction and 
5.  it can do especially in an engineering design and

172
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,380
action so it can know so it can also

173
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,400
allow to modify the reality okay for

174
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,160
description for when when a theory

175
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,220
describe analyze a problem okay

176
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,920
the product is normally this are

177
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,150
normally descriptions and

178
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,070
conceptualization so a theory can be a

179
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,230
taxonomy and ontology like the case of

180
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,080
the defect types that I that I gave

181
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,030
before okay so the that one was a

182
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,000
descriptive theory okay the the the fact

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,080
that the requirements defects can be

184
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,300
classified according to those the

185
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,920
and classes okay app you can also

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,980
explain so can allow to identify the

187
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,610
motivation for for something and in this

188
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,850
case you have to consider the example of

189
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,149
the team leader so the the team leader

190
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:16,339
example tells us the motivation why

191
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,589
people develop a stand to lose trust so

192
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,870
it can it is explained according to the

193
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,760
to the degree of self-confidence of the

194
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,870
team leader okay it can predict so I I

195
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,260
build the model and I predict how things

196
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,110
are in the reality like in the fourth

197
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,040
example so in the example in which I was

198
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,760
speaking about the presence of folds in

199
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,220
that our founding functions that are

200
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,740
longer that 1000 line of code so this is

201
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,320
the model if I found a function that is

202
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,050
longer and times a thousand level code I

203
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,660
can predict that there will be some

204
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,839
force explanation is pretty important so

205
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,510
I find them order so I I find the mother

206
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,860
about the for predicting the folds and I

207
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,649
also find the motivation why longer

208
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,329
function of functions that are longer

209
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:16,829
that a certain amount of lines are are

210
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,520
more faulty okay or I can do also design

211
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,110
an action with the theory designer

212
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,200
action means that I use the information

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,770
to transform a reality this this is the

214
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,140
I don't have the example here but if you

215
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,120
remember in the first lecture I was

216
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
giving you an example about testing

217
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,990
resources the one about the developers

218
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,709
that if they code at night they create

219
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,480
more bugs and they are more productive

220
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,630
but they are more productive so the the

221
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,180
solution was the solution theory

222
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,880
actually I called it at that time the

223
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,899
solution theory was to dedicate more

224
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,110
more testing resources to the to the

225
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,970
code developer that developed at night

226
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,520
okay so this is another type of theory

227
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,760
so is a theory is a solution theory

228
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,960
oriented to design an action

229
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,910
remember that the theory can do all

230
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,680
these type of things and and the example

231
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,790
are quite clarifying I guess now we've

232
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,980
seen what is a theory what a theory does

233
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,210
and now we will see what are the

234
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,410
elements okay

235
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,350
the elements are if you want to remember

236
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,200
them you can you can remember also the

237
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,380
typical questions to which to which they

238
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,360
refer so first of all what first first

239
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,880
first question is what and it's let's

240
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,980
let's read here what are the entities is

241
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,020
tara misu in terms of which a theory of

242
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,680
a description explanation prediction and

243
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,080
prescription these are the constructs of

244
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,750
the theory so the eletric element the

245
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,779
basic entities okay that form the theory

246
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:01,540
are called constructs we use this term

247
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,990
later on okay then there is a question

248
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,709
how that as a that is referred to how

249
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,620
these constructs are related okay what

250
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,810
are the relationship and the second

251
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,930
thing that that builds a theory are the

252
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,920
propositions so statements about the

253
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,510
interaction between constructs by

254
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,250
constructs I will give you example later

255
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,060
on we intend basically if you're if you

256
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,490
are confident with the entity relation

257
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,830
if a relationship diagram all the

258
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,410
entities so it can be objects but also

259
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,779
attributes okay the constructs so we

260
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,600
will see some example a zero okay so we

261
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,959
have concerts prepositions and the

262
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,000
preposition can also lead to prediction

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,709
of course but here just remember

264
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,420
concerts and preposition and there is a

265
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,970
third question that that is why a

266
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,770
certain relationship holds so this is

267
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,290
what gives theory explanatory power we

268
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,300
will see this you know in the next slide

269
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,950
and in the end I have a several other

270
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,230
questions which are aware when and for

271
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,660
whom that are the scope condition that

272
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,730
you didn't identify the circumstances in

273
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,550
which the theory is applicable so these

274
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,589
question is addiction a question are the

275
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:29,260
context so construct propositions the

276
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,450
answer to the question why motivation

277
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,440
for which certain relationship also the

278
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,339
explanation okay and scope condition

279
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,870
concepts prediction explanation a scope

280
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,120
condition we will see example of these

281
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,510
elements very soon so constructs

282
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,790
construct what concept has the elements

283
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,180
okay here are example to give you a

284
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,660
flavor of what is what is what we intend

285
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,230
here

286
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,540
UML based development methods if you

287
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,250
don't know what is UML you can check

288
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,220
internet but is the basically a set of a

289
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,990
set of diagrams that are oriented to

290
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,149
design software for mostly for object

291
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:15,730
oriented design okay and the development

292
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,269
method based on UML consists in using

293
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,470
this diagram to guide the development of

294
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,339
software so for creating the the

295
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,560
software design and architecture that

296
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,209
that allows them to develop from that

297
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:37,209
that is the blueprint for developing the

298
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,260
soft okay but also costs communication

299
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,020
design documentation testability so

300
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,870
these are all concept okay all the

301
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,630
constructs are concept that are relevant

302
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,290
for my research and I relevant form a

303
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,579
theory okay proposition how how the

304
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,649
construct interact for example here

305
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:03,040
there is a list of proposition this is a

306
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,589
proposal p4 is a proposition for example

307
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,660
the use of a UML based development

308
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,540
method positively effects documentation

309
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,970
so using this method you have a better

310
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,560
documentation this is a proposition

311
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,079
because it relates UML development

312
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,120
method with another with another

313
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,600
caustics with concert which is

314
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,410
documentation okay explanation

315
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,600
explanation is the third component as

316
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,730
and explain why why this relationship

317
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,589
before old hold

318
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,170
the documentation is more complete more

319
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,970
consistent because there is the more

320
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,279
traceability between models and code it

321
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,410
means that I can trace the blueprint so

322
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,050
the diagrams with the actual codes more

323
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,970
understandable more readable so there

324
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,809
are justification for the truth of the

325
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,459
proposition okay and the scope condition

326
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,139
so the other the answer to the other

327
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,269
question you have to remember when where

328
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,970
and whom but the thing that is actually

329
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,749
relevant is more thinking also about the

330
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,480
the actual context the thing that

331
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,089
characterized the context of my theory

332
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,470
for example for this theory this theory

333
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,970
is supposed to be applicable for

334
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,819
distributed projects in which the

335
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:26,040
operation our creation modification of

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,379
embedded safety critical system based on

337
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,379
legacy code or new code so quite a wide

338
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,629
range of system but clearly here it

339
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,600
refers to embedded systems ok so this

340
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,699
theory for example is not applicable is

341
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,889
applicable for software that goes in a

342
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,269
car or in a you know in a in a train or

343
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,300
in an aircraft but is not applicable or

344
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,430
at least it was not verified in a

345
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,509
context of financial systems or like or

346
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:57,519
systems that for for the public

347
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,629
administration ok

348
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,240
ok in this example and it is the

349
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,980
important thing to consider I am

350
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,270
answering all the questions ok but most

351
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,020
of the time you leave out you leave out

352
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,069
too why very frequently ok so a theory

353
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,898
in principle should answer all this

354
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:23,530
question ok but very often the

355
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,319
explanatory power so the the way a

356
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,039
theory is able to explain why is is very

357
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,309
frequently quite weak and you often need

358
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:37,059
more studies for developing an answer to

359
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:42,730
how and an answer to why ok so this is

360
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,549
for the elements then we want to

361
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:48,010
understand how theories are formed

362
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,350
there are several strategies okay for

363
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,330
performing theories and you will see

364
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,210
that our method the method that that we

365
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,600
will study are applying one or more or

366
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,830
more of these strategies

367
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,330
okay so first strategy is is the

368
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,930
induction okay I take an observation I

369
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,480
observe the reality and I infer a

370
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,210
generalized conclusion from particular

371
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,200
instances so take an observation of over

372
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,350
set of developers and I start developing

373
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,540
the theory so identify first the

374
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,060
constructs than the proposition the

375
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,600
explanation and the scope okay and the

376
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,990
context from the theory I can deduce

377
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,930
some hypothesis I can define some some

378
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,270
possible hypothesis that will be derived

379
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:42,340
directly by my proposition okay and then

380
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,310
I have to attest hypothesis so this is

381
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,030
the second step that is deduction and

382
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,320
deduction means taking the proposition

383
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,780
of the theory derive testable hypothesis

384
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,270
you will see testable hypothesis in the

385
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,540
next lecture like a large set of example

386
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,400
and then you have to verify that

387
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,160
actually deals Deportes are true by

388
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,470
observing the reality so you compare the

389
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,840
hypothesis against the reality when you

390
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,930
have built the theory through this

391
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,110
through this iteration okay so you have

392
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,880
inducted and you have elicited some

393
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,750
information and you have deduced

394
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,790
testable hypothesis for the theory then

395
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:28,150
you may want to extend the theory to to

396
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,830
other feet for example you've developed

397
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,380
the theory for the one that I want that

398
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,600
I was showing before for embedded system

399
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,810
and you may infer that that theory may

400
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,710
be applicable also in the context of

401
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,260
public administration system then I

402
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,620
deduce new hypothesis and I test them in

403
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,440
the public administration system so this

404
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,140
is the way the sig cycle works so I

405
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,510
start normally from induction but very

406
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,840
frequently there is already some theory

407
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,850
around so some information around

408
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,940
so some some preposition that I need to

409
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,090
that I need to verify from this I

410
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,250
there's reduce I bought this I test them

411
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,970
in my environment and when I have some

412
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,170
solid theories or referred to similar

413
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,310
context I can abduct so I can use the

414
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:30,340
method of abduction and in take a more

415
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,620
creates let's say a more general theory

416
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,800
and port it to another context okay I

417
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,690
port it to another context and derive

418
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,660
new hypothesis and perform a new test

419
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,430
and observation okay yeah and derive new

420
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,730
testable hypothesis for a theory also

421
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,910
for through the second step of deduction

422
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,580
so remember this induction comes from

423
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,490
observation to theory deduction comes

424
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,760
from theory to hypothesize and abduction

425
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,570
from accounts go from theory to theory

426
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,800
okay how do I evaluate the theory once I

427
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,260
have developed my theory how can I

428
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,160
evaluate it here are six criteria for

1. Testability 
The degree to which a theory is constructed such that empirical refutation is possible

429
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,350
evaluating it okay first of all

430
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,190
testability

431
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:25,630
so a theory is somehow scientific if if

432
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,330
it is built in such a way that it can be

433
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,020
falsified okay it can be tested you can

434
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,780
be tested we will see this falsification

435
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,950
concept later on here I I wanted to

436
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,590
leave it I wanted not to focus on it

437
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,410
because it is more related to the way we

438
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,020
test quantitative theory but in any case

439
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,320
testability is is a theory that can be

440
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,690
can be put against reality and we can do

441
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,350
some empirical refutation okay ?

2. Empirical support 
The degree to which a theory is supported by empirical studies that confirm its validity
3. Explanatory power 
The degree to which a theory accounts for and predicts all known observations within its scope, is simple in that it has few ad hoc assumption, and relates to that which is already well understood
Explantory power : to what extent my theory explain WHY?


442
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,590
empirical support : how many studies are supporting

443
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,050
it how much information from empirical

444
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,970
studies that are actually supporting my

445
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,610
theory then I have explanatory power

446
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,790
that is to assistant my theory explains

447
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,630
why

448
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,000
okay explain why question 

449
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,940
so if I considered all the possible motivation that may have lead to this to this

451
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,780
conclusion or I might lose in something

452
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,200
so in there for example in the example

453
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,460
before in which I have the the list of

454
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,300
the list of reason why UML allow UML

455
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,810
makes makes documentation better I may

456
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,750
have I have my F mister some some other

457
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,760
some other variables that might have

458
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,540
influenced my my outcome and so there

459
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,720
may be different reasons with respect to

460
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,780
the one that I found for explaining my theory 

4. Parsimony 
The degree to which a theory is economically constructed with a minimum of concepts and propositions

461
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,600
okay parsimony so how much how

462
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,230
much fo did I make to to minimize the

463
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,740
number of constructs involved in also

5. Generality 
The breadth of the scope of a theory and the degree to which the theory is independent of specific settings

464
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,130
proposition generality so how large is

465
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,120
the scope of material many context am I

466
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,740
am i covering with this theory and

6. Utility 
The degree to which a theory supports the relevant areas of the software  industry

467
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,620
utility utility is very important for

468
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,070
our domain because the knowledge that i

469
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,850
acquire through the empirical software

470
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,880
engineering research it needs to be

471
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,490
useful okay it needs to have to a

472
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,040
certain extent to some applicability so

473
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,300
the as it was shown in the first lecture

474
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,600
the path is always arriving to a

475
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,330
solution theory to a theory that is

476
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,240
oriented to transform the reality okay

477
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,320
this is this is a peculiarity of

478
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,910
software engineering theories okay to

479
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,240
consider how useful can baby it is

480
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,020
always not always easy to say okay this

481
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,220
theory is useful and this is not but it

482
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,580
is it is important to reflect and to

483
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,220
make some arguments why it could be

484
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,470
useful okay because it is true that

485
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,440
science and many things that we

486
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,890
developed through research the their

487
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,800
utility may not be self-evident okay

488
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,140
but in software engineering research you

489
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,480
have to argue since it's not fundamental

490
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,970
research in research related to company

491
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,260
to weight people to the way people

492
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,680
behave to code into something very very

493
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,620
concrete very very practical utility is

494
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,150
very relevant ok so how do I formulate

495
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,510
theories this is a step to step guide of

496
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,100
course as you may have known from from

497
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,530
your experiences software developers

498
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,020
thing never works step by step of course

499
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,790
but to to somehow communicate them we

500
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,280
need to we need to use the we need to

501
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,500
pretend that they are working step by

502
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,640
step okay so first of all we need to

503
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,620
define the construct of the theory so

504
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,750
which are the building blocks so this

505
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,300
can be another construct so or existing

506
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,820
one so taking from existing theories

507
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,110
that I want to let I want to take as as

508
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,080
a reference or they can be refinements

509
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,120
of a existing one so I take constructs

510
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,700
from other theories from other from

511
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,680
other research from other literature and

512
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,790
I refine them okay so for example in the

513
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,180
case UML development methods I may want

514
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,490
taking that theory I may want to

515
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,940
consider only one type of diagram the

516
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,550
class diagrams okay to which a stand the

517
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,190
class diagrams for example help in

518
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,310
improving documentation okay this can be

519
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:02,170
a way of taking a theory and trying to

520
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:07,060
build on that by refining by refining

521
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,870
the cost art or I can I can use norther

522
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,120
constructs that are somehow related to

523
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,370
the previous one for example another

524
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,450
type of diagram

525
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,160
another type of another type of

526
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,240
development style so this this this is

527
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,640
to tell you that every time you build

528
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,050
the theory you may take also

529
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,940
subconsciously inspiration from some

530
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,450
theory that already exists it is good

531
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,730
that you make it explicit when you

532
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,779
define the theory

533
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:44,599
what are the drivers and what are the

534
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,749
sources from which you are taking your

535
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:50,509
constants okay then you defy proposition

536
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,309
again that can be novel they can be

537
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,200
modification or refinements of the

538
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,460
existing ones and and basically they

539
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,679
connect our caustics that our

540
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,989
relationship then I can provide

541
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,960
explanation to justify the theory so a

542
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,239
series of assumption and logical

543
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:11,210
justification and this is planation they

544
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,119
can refer to existing theories and they

545
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,519
can come also from other disciplines so

546
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:20,179
the possible explanation so again an

547
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,669
explanation is related to an Acosta okay

548
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,099
there is a motivation that is X that

549
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:28,609
explain a relationship between concepts

550
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,479
okay and the it is represented here the

551
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:34,309
explanation is the source of this

552
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:37,099
relation is this other cost or

553
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:41,359
activities it is this other element okay

554
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,429
and finally the finder scope of interest

555
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,070
okay the fourth the fourth element that

556
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,139
are the value Co values of the

557
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:50,869
constructs and their combination dedi

558
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,479
theory is oriented to explain okay we

559
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:54,979
will see that there is a difference

560
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,570
between the scope of interest and the

561
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,749
scope of validity but in an hour here we

562
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:02,239
are interested in want what we are

563
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:06,549
oriented to explain with our theory

564
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:09,619
remember that every time yeah you you

565
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:11,419
apply an empirical method you are

566
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,879
actually building theory so your goal is

567
00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:16,009
always to build a theory with a

568
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:18,769
different with a different flavor so

569
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,729
descriptive explanatory predictive but

570
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:27,529
still your bidding theory after I built

571
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,450
this theory I need to test it okay

572
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,570
otherwise there's no empiricism okay I

573
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,749
have to evaluate how valid is this

574
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:38,089
theory and this steps are this one I

575
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:40,190
have to research I have to select a

576
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,549
research setting and sample by sample

577
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:47,659
here I mean not just actors but activity

578
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,289
system so all the things all the

579
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:53,089
components that that I can use in

580
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:55,980
reality to to identify

581
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,299
Cass constructs and and to test my

582
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,580
theory okay research setting here it can

583
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,220
be like for example a company or can be

584
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,460
a laboratory yeah we will see in the

585
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,500
different in the different examples of

586
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,780
research types in research strategies

587
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,730
that different settings are possible

588
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,690
more natural or more contrived so more

589
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,480
artificial like a lab is an artificial

590
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,390
setting a company is a more natural

591
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:32,870
setting okay then i io / externalize

592
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,820
theoretical construct into empirical

593
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,760
variables so I transform these contracts

594
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,270
in variable that they can be measured in

595
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,120
reality so a term like testability or

596
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,650
documentation quality needs to be

597
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,110
measured okay and then I translate this

598
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,290
into theoretical problem the theoretical

599
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,450
proposition so the propositions that are

600
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,540
belong to the theory into hypothesis as

601
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,850
I was saying before so I transform this

602
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,490
proposition in hypothesis that I can

603
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,400
test the hypotheses are expressed in

604
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,520
terms of empirical variables and this is

605
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,640
typical of qualitative studies okay but

606
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,150
the philosophy is very similar also for

607
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,000
quantitative side study so is is

608
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,030
something that that you have to consider

609
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,270
for any type of theory okay and then I

610
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,190
have to test the hypotheses so I have to

611
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,340
verify that these hypotheses actually

612
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,520
actually holds for for my for my context

613
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,580
okay and when we speak about the

614
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,000
Protestant testing is always we always

615
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,460
refer to quantitative statistical tests

616
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,429
but as I was saying before this process

617
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,470
applies to both quantitative a

618
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,090
qualitative method although the

619
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,900
terminology is like empirical variable

620
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,970
and precut testable hypothesis and

621
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,160
testing the hypotheses are really mostly

622
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,210
for quantitative studies and and

623
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,280
experiments especially okay

624
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,230
and finally the finder scope of validity

625
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,350
okay I have tested I have selected a sample

626
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:18,310
and therefore I didn't I didn't

627
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,040
verify my theory for the whole possible

628
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,160
set of samples but just for a specific

629
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,020
set of cases okay

630
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,450
scope of validity is the part of the

631
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,920
scope of interest in which the theory

632
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,550
has actually been validated okay so here

633
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:38,290
is the summary in terms of a graphical

634
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,380
summary of how the theory is built

635
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,580
according to the steps that I gave you

636
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,810
before so first of all the constructs

637
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:51,570
the propositions explanation and then

638
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,230
the scope of interest okay then given

639
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,330
this this is the feeling from which I

640
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,350
start I operationalized the variables

641
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,880
and I transform and identify my

642
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
apophysis that are basically the

643
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,750
representation of the proposition in

644
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,040
terms of the concrete variables okay and

645
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,360
identify the sample you already see that

646
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,830
this sample is smaller than the than the

647
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,600
context of the theory okay

648
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,490
and then I here I'm still somehow in an

649
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,610
abstract space but closer to reality the

650
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,410
final step is data collection and

651
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,300
measurements in which I actually go to

652
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,760
the reality and collect this data once I

653
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,830
have defined the sample I can apply the

654
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,270
sampling strategy and I can identify oh

655
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,430
my data with the different data

656
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,860
collection techniques that I explained

657
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,620
you last time at this point sorry this

658
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,740
point I can have in my daughter I can

659
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,080
test whether my effort as you sold so

660
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,600
given my data I said hey is this

661
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,830
hypothesis true or not I can confirm and

662
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,490
reject the hypothesis and therefore

663
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,060
support or not support my theory and I

664
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,700
can identify my scope of validity so

665
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,400
after I am verified in a certain

666
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,350
specific context and I have identified

667
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,360
the scope abilities I can say okay my

668
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:22,929
theory

669
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:26,889
for the specific context the scope of

670
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:29,019
validity here you have an interesting

671
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:33,219
image that tells you that you to cover

672
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,619
the scope of interest of a theory

673
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:38,739
you know you need multiple studies they

674
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:41,519
make over different scope of validity ok

675
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,169
so here you have a scope of validity for

676
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,450
study one for study to study three and

677
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:51,249
all together they cover a part of the

678
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:53,440
possible scope of interest of the theory

679
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,859
okay

680
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:58,960
Kress to validity this is another

681
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,839
important point that you will encounter

682
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,659
in every method okay the fact that

683
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,849
you've done all this very nice very nice

684
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:11,980
process of starting from the theory and

685
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,679
empirical verification etc doesn't mean

686
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,489
that your theory is is accepted or

687
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,429
reject okay you need to provide

688
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,918
arguments that you needed you didn't do

689
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,039
any mistake okay and you need to provide

690
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,799
arguments that you didn't do especially

691
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:31,960
invalid operationalization of

692
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,029
theoretical constructs and propositions

693
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:41,429
so for example you need to justify the fact that a constructs successor 

695
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:44,730
says the complexity of the code is

696
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,799
represented with line of codes is it's a

697
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,500
valid operationalization or not you need

698
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,539
to provide arguments okay to which

699
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:56,349
extent this operationalization is valid

700
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:59,529
or inappropriate research design so you

701
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:03,039
may have selected you may have selected

702
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:05,200
the wrong sample you may have made a

703
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,180
mistake in the data collection

704
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,880
procedures in the data analysis

705
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,849
procedures so you may have made mistakes

706
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:14,020
across the step and you need to

707
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,289
demonstrate that you didn't do that in

708
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,240
accuracy in data collection and data

709
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,309
analysis this is related to of course to

710
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:23,250
an inappropriate research design and

711
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,299
possible misinterpretation of the

712
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:28,150
empirical findings so what you found was

713
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,240
actually clearly leading with the data

714
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,410
and you didn't do any wrong

715
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,640
interpretation

716
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,640
in general each research method as his

717
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,549
own classification that that those that

718
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:45,630
I listed before where some intuitions

719
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,230
through behind the concept of tres to

720
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,089
validity so anything that you could have

721
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:55,450
done wrong in this process okay but then

722
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:00,339
in in in each type of research research

723
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:01,859
methods you use a different

724
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,970
classification for because you may have

725
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,059
different types of threats different

726
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:08,940
type of mistakes that you have made and

727
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,099
this is a general classification that is

728
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:15,099
typical for experiments and that but it

729
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,910
is useful to remember okay because it it

730
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,630
gives you the the flavor of what are the

731
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,210
main concern interest to validity

732
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:25,960
evaluation

733
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,589
first of all construct validity that is

734
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,519
related to the question that I was

735
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,740
explaining before am i operationalize

736
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,319
the older concert correctly so my

737
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:38,440
constructs are actually represented in a

738
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,500
proper way by my variables this is this

739
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,359
is the question okay and you have to

740
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,299
provide sufficient arguments internal

741
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:49,569
validity other any aspects that may have

742
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:52,029
influenced my outcome and I did not

743
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:55,299
consider this is related mostly to your

744
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:58,000
design and data collection method okay

745
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,490
and in this case you have to identify

746
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:03,250
which are the possible variables that

747
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,869
you didn't control and you didn't

748
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:10,930
consider and and that may have had an

749
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,569
impact on your design for example if I

750
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:18,210
am evaluating the complexity of a code

751
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,630
and I'm using some code samples okay and

752
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,079
I want to let the people actual people

753
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,450
assess the degree of complexity of this

754
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,869
code I have to be sure that these people

755
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,089
did not already see the chords that they

756
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:36,730
are evaluating because otherwise the

757
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,849
evaluation of complexity is biased okay

758
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:44,049
if you all know already if you've seen

759
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:46,900
already a certain code of course it will

760
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,160
be less complex than

761
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,930
then for another person who didn't see

762
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,660
it who didn't see it who never saw it

763
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,890
okay these are typical internal threats

764
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,900
so other variable that you did not

765
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,880
consider in your experiment or in your

766
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,040
in your study and that have an influence

767
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,900
all on your outcome external validity

768
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,790
that is related to which extent are my

769
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,100
findings generalizable so this is

770
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,820
related to how much my scope of validity

771
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,270
basically covers my scope of interest or

772
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,630
how many contexts can I cover okay which

773
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,340
for example which type of languages are

774
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,869
considered here in this example

775
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,930
complexity yes but may it be different

776
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:37,890
from if I if I am covering C code and

777
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,920
Python code so if my experiment is made

778
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,040
on both C code and Python code then I

779
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,260
have quite a good external validity but

780
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,770
if it's just made of one type of code is

781
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,050
more limited okay this is these are

782
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,570
three that are quite clear and I think

783
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,470
quite intuitive as type of threats

784
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,900
okay this we saw in the example before

785
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,170
let's let's make a step back in the

786
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,510
example before we saw this we saw that

787
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,060
we were passing from theory to reality

788
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,470
okay this was the the typical the

789
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,550
typical process for a deductive approach

790
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,490
if you remember the lead early slides

791
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,250
because I'm starting from theory I

792
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,040
assume that I built the theory somehow

793
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,130
and I go towards reality but the reality

794
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,440
could be though so that I don't have a

795
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,640
theory yet so I need to start from

796
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,170
observation I need to start from the

797
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,000
from the reality and in this case I use

798
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,130
the so-called inductive approach so the

799
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,619
one that I showed before is the typical

800
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,640
say if you want the positivist approach

801
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,869
for constructing constructing theory so

802
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:00,420
the deductive one you start from some

803
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,609
constructs from the lead shutters from

804
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:02,970
trip

805
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,730
positions and you create hypothesis and

806
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,610
your new test but in our in our diagram

807
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,460
which also the inductive process okay we

808
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,700
will not cover here abductive processes

809
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,560
but inductive is important because it's

810
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,370
typical of the so called constructive

811
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,570
constructivist approaches that are one

812
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,140
the ones using used in qualitative in

813
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,060
qualitative studies so in this case I

814
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,880
start from simple definition and data

815
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,010
collection for example I collect some

816
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,950
interviews in a company and then from

817
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,490
these interviews I identify which are

818
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,740
the constructs okay then I I sold the

819
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,810
basic thing is that I start from my

820
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,100
simple definition and then afterwards I

821
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,070
identify variables and propositions okay

822
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,070
and from this I can build my theory so

823
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,020
the theory comes afterwards I am

824
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,460
eliciting the theory from from the data

825
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,110
okay I can combine the two approaches of

826
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,940
course because in a case in which I

827
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,280
don't know much about a certain reality

828
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
like the reality of a specific company

829
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,260
and I have to start with the collection

830
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,720
of interviews before knowing what is

831
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,390
actually relevant what what time for

832
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,550
example in the case that in the example

833
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,070
before what are the elements that may

834
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:31,230
affect the day or in which way the UML

835
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,940
language can affect the development to

836
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,850
understand the ways I have to treat to

837
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,070
ask to people to understand that till

838
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,620
for example it affects documentation it

839
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,630
affects the stability or rather or other

840
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,480
aspects okay then I have built the

841
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,420
theory in an inductive way but

842
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,510
afterwards I have to test the theory and

843
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,080
I can apply a deductive approach okay I

844
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,520
can take my preposition I can

845
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,410
operationalized in into more refined

846
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,130
variables for example into more measure

847
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,560
measurable variables so give a way of

848
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,890
evaluating the quality of documentation

849
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,220
then I do again a round of some

850
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,380
definition and out of election and in

851
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,319
this case I do my POTUS is testing so I

852
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,280
reduce my policies I test processes and

853
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,220
then I can refute on confirm the theory

854
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,890
so inductive process and deductive

855
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,950
process are combined and are made of

856
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,200
different steps of the field of the

857
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,640
theory constructions and they are used

858
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,849
at different stages okay in one case I

859
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:46,890
use the inductive processes if I don't

860
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,310
know anything about about a context and

861
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,940
I use a deductive process if I if I

862
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,520
already have some theory or I can build

863
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,800
something from the information that I

864
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,150
have already collected this remembers us

865
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,829
when we were speaking about the

866
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,569
different research questions okay

867
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:09,060
because theories are built and are

868
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,880
guided in a hidden way here in this

869
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,010
presentation also by research questions

870
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,780
okay when we were thinking about the

871
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,230
research question we were thinking about

872
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,660
exploratory explanatory so different

873
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,530
type of questions depending on how much

874
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,410
information do I have about a certain

875
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,260
context and this is strictly related to

876
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,079
this to this diagram first of all I will

877
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,109
have exploratory research questions and

878
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:42,510
I always tend to induct I will tend to

879
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,690
use a research approach that is more

880
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,630
inductive once I have the theory

881
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,329
I will go towards more explanatory or

882
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:56,400
more predictive predictive research

883
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,010
questions and I will tend to use

884
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,180
deductive approach okay

885
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,609
now I'll give you an example in here I

886
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,010
was hiding the example between the lines

887
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,410
but this is the example basically this

888
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:13,440
is taken from the paper that I used as a

889
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,079
reference here for for building this

890
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,940
this lecture and I invite you also to

891
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,349
read the paper because of course it

892
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:24,089
contains much more information that I

893
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:25,980
wanted that the one that I could give

894
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,170
here here the example is

895
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,890
with a field study a field study so I

896
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,069
study in a company basically to

897
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:40,170
investigate benefits and challenges of

898
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:44,099
the use of UML in a large distributed

899
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:46,200
development process so development

900
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,819
project so you have large and

901
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,319
distributed means that you have

902
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,079
different people working in different in

903
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,740
different areas so for example one is in

904
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,869
Milan where is in Florence or even one

905
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,390
in India one in Italy okay so different

906
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,390
teams belonging to the organization but

907
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,220
located in different geographical

908
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,160
locations and you want to understand

909
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,089
whether this UML works fine or not so

910
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:14,490
what are the benefits and the challenges

911
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,700
and the project was concerned the

912
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,619
project that they were developing is

913
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:21,690
concerned with a safety critical process

914
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,530
control system okay you don't this is

915
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,170
needed just to identify the scope later

916
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,230
on in this case you are four sites in

917
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,900
three countries so not just Milan

918
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,119
Florence but other country for example

919
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:39,480
in Germany and in France and you have

920
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,450
many people two hundred and thirty and a

921
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,119
hundred of them are using actually a UML

922
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,809
ok so they put they could collect

923
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:51,809
information from individual interviews

924
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,970
questionnaires and project documents so

925
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:56,579
the data collection was using different

926
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,030
strategies okay both interviews

927
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,130
questionnaires or surveys and also

928
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,799
document analysis okay also taking the

929
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,349
documentation so you see already the

930
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:09,150
data collection strategies that I

931
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,490
explained you before they come they come

932
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,760
handy you have here some people

933
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,640
intensive people intensive data

934
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,680
collection methods like interviews and

935
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,380
some system intensive all objects

936
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,089
intensive like project documents okay

937
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:29,280
first I define the constructs and to do

938
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,980
that I perform a series of interviews

939
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,079
okay and I from this interview that I

940
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:38,819
performed with the people in the company

941
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,040
identify which are the most significant

942
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,430
concepts okay and how do I do that

943
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:44,970
you

944
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,950
learned this when we do qualitative

945
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,160
study and basically it's a strategy

946
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,950
called open coding that means

947
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,780
lovey-lovey in the concepts in the

948
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,849
Inditex finding representation finding

949
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,890
fragments in the text that represent my

950
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,410
my concepts okay so if people for

951
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,380
example like in a trivial case they

952
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,460
mention that documentation many time

953
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,160
documentation may may be relevant and so

954
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,460
this is one of my constant okay and I

955
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,099
can find it

956
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,930
during the interview okay they are

957
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,849
speaking about documentation and so this

958
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:26,280
is a relevant constructs these are the

959
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,990
examples the same way that I gave you

960
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,450
before so code UML based development

961
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,400
methods is a constructs because we are

962
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,460
speaking about that cause communication

963
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,869
design documentation so these are all

964
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:43,500
the building blocks that I want to

965
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,750
consider in my theory and that are

966
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,660
elicited they are identified in the

967
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,580
interview transcripts okay in their

968
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,930
interview with the people people are

969
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,720
speaking about this thing so they are

970
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,160
elements that I need to consider my

971
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,150
theory propositions propositions still

972
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,960
from these interviews I can identify not

973
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,520
just the elements but also the

974
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,589
relationship again the paradigm of

975
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:10,770
entity relationship diagrams is is still

976
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,230
relevant here like you have identified

977
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:15,270
the entities and now still in the

978
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,130
interviews you identify the relationship

979
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,830
and these are translated into

980
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,160
propositions okay now I have a series of

981
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,560
relationships for example UML decrease

982
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,530
in the effects cost so increases costs

983
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,170
and I want to understand whether this

984
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,970
proposition that I gathered from the

985
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:37,170
interview are actually true for for all

986
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:39,119
the people because the interview some

987
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,430
people may mention this aspect and some

988
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,250
people may not so I need to test this

989
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,130
with questioners this this preposition

990
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,280
to make them more solid okay then I

991
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,760
provide explanation display I see that

992
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,230
the in the interview there is some

993
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,330
explanation that explained the reason

994
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:57,999
behind

995
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:01,749
position okay and but in some cases for

996
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,699
example I may have no explanation so I

997
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:05,649
perform further interview that are more

998
00:49:05,649 --> 00:49:09,099
focused on finding explanation for

999
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:11,349
certain statements of the of the people

1000
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:14,319
and that allow me to list the

1001
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,509
destination for example Here I am the

1002
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:18,669
illumination is more complete more

1003
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:20,859
consistent more readable because it

1004
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:22,059
makes it easier to find specific

1005
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,809
information to a common format more

1006
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:28,089
understandable for non-technical people

1007
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:30,489
so if I have the diagram it is more

1008
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:33,579
understandable because technical people

1009
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,979
find it easier to understand the diagram

1010
00:49:35,979 --> 00:49:38,649
that the technical written that the

1011
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:43,269
technical text okay it may be viewed

1012
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:44,619
from different expressed paired

1013
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,329
different perspective because I have

1014
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:48,939
different types of diagrams so these are

1015
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:50,499
all motivations that I can find in the

1016
00:49:50,499 --> 00:49:53,949
interviews so we are at the step 3 now

1017
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,649
step 4 it is define the scope of

1018
00:49:56,649 --> 00:49:58,119
interest of the theory so with this

1019
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:01,419
theory in principle what do I want to

1020
00:50:01,419 --> 00:50:03,849
cover okay I started from a specific

1021
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:06,369
company's company large company what do

1022
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:09,849
but my inspiration my aspiration is that

1023
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:13,059
I want this theory to hold in a large

1024
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:15,939
broad scope ok that is the scope of

1025
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:18,969
interest so my theory the scope of

1026
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:20,649
interest in general in software

1027
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:22,749
engineering can be defined according to

1028
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:24,669
these four elements one is the

1029
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:26,259
technologies that I consider it

1030
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:28,779
considering and it is UML in this case

1031
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:31,629
the actor the actors that are involved

1032
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,929
and here are designers in distributed

1033
00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:38,549
team so this characterized my my actors

1034
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:41,439
software system here the type of

1035
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:43,509
software system in amber is embedded

1036
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:45,759
software large-sized embedded embedded

1037
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:49,899
software and activity activities in this

1038
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:53,079
case create a modify UML diagram so if

1039
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:57,299
the editing of I could could also have

1040
00:50:57,299 --> 00:51:00,429
called activity tasks for example tasks

1041
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:02,679
that I'm doing is designing

1042
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:07,179
okay design software design finally I

1043
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:09,219
need to test the theory so I've done all

1044
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:11,660
this interview all this step in

1045
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,329
inductive way because I was following an

1046
00:51:14,329 --> 00:51:16,640
inductive process starting from the date

1047
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,180
of the interviews and eliciting

1048
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,460
proposition and theory but then I now I

1049
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,789
I have the theory but this theory is not

1050
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:29,530
fully robust let's say because I need to

1051
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:34,309
to prove it ok it's not proved I need to

1052
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:38,329
to bio to verify ok and in this case I

1053
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,760
apply deductive step that is that means

1054
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,809
that I take the single proposition or a

1055
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:48,549
subset because probably to verify with

1056
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:50,869
quantitative methods a deductive

1057
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:54,380
approach I cannot consider all the

1058
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,299
proposition all together but better to

1059
00:51:56,299 --> 00:52:00,500
focus on one at a time and translate

1060
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,670
into hypotheses and do some do some

1061
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:07,700
study ok for example I can use I can

1062
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,410
take the proposition use of um add

1063
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,109
methods increases costs and I can decide

1064
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:15,859
to assess whether these hypo with is

1065
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:17,809
this preposition that can become an app

1066
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:20,349
or can be translated into an ecologist

1067
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:23,890
it's true by doing by using different

1068
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,270
methods for example I can do a field

1069
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,700
study sorry for the typo here but is

1070
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,819
field study an experiment or a survey

1071
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:34,279
for example if I do a field study I can

1072
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,559
identify companies that want to

1073
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,369
introduce UML and establish a clear way

1074
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:43,220
to evaluate the cost so I say ok men our

1075
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,039
is my way of evaluate cost I consider

1076
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:48,559
another comparable company that's not

1077
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,549
using UML and I check the resulting cost

1078
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:54,950
of the two companies so here I am

1079
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:58,510
studying in the real world someone that

1080
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,579
is introducing UML and someone that is

1081
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:04,760
not and I compare the cost if the one

1082
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,089
that is introduced in UML is is having

1083
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:12,710
higher costs then I can I can I can say

1084
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:16,130
that it is true it is at least it is not

1085
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,609
false that the use of your main methods

1086
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:24,980
increases costs okay then

1087
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,080
then I can or I can do I can choose to

1088
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,210
do an experiment for example an

1089
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,400
experiment still related to the same

1090
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,710
proposition in this case I take two

1091
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,690
group of subjects I give them a

1092
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:37,580
requirements document written in natural

1093
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,890
language so that explain basically what

1094
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:43,070
the system should do I ask group one to

1095
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,600
take the document and write down the

1096
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,180
code and group two to write the diagram

1097
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,430
and then implement the code and then I

1098
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,830
can evaluate and compare the cost okay

1099
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:54,440
in this case I'm performing an

1100
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,290
experiment very narrow take group of

1101
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,260
subjects in a lab environment with a

1102
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,310
very well-defined requirement document I

1103
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,440
have constrained in terms of constraints

1104
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,570
since then most are in terms of time it

1105
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,180
does not scale - it does not consider

1106
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,850
the whole context of a company but still

1107
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,750
it's another way to evaluate to evaluate

1108
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:21,830
whether this this proposition is biased

1109
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,050
to assess my hypotheses or I can do a

1110
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,390
survey a question so with the same

1111
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:29,000
statement I can contact contact multiple

1112
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,700
companies that have introduced UML and I

1113
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,890
can ask them the same questions that it

1114
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,020
asks them to stay their agreement with

1115
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,450
with my proposition in this case I can

1116
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:42,550
reach more people and I can I can have

1117
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:47,060
an answer to more than one to two more

1118
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,190
than one of these questions but of

1119
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:52,850
course I cannot go too deep into the

1120
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,300
reasons for example why someone is

1121
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,460
choosing a certain answer or not we will

1122
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,270
see that so this this survey and we will

1123
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,460
see all this type of study in our in our

1124
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:10,940
in our class so based on this let's

1125
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,980
study then identify the scope of

1126
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,040
validity that is larger for survey and I

1127
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,280
referred narrower for kill study as I

1128
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,640
was saying if I am using a survey I am

1129
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,240
reaching many more people than if I do a

1130
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,359
fit study so if his study is proving

1131
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,950
somehow is verifying the hypothesis

1132
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:37,280
testing the hypothesis in a more

1133
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,260
restricted context

1134
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,620
okay but if I do a survey I am verifying

1135
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,980
and testing my hypothesis in a much

1136
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:51,980
broader much larger context okay then

1137
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,800
still in this example I as I said before

1138
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,720
the these different ways of evaluating

1139
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,680
the theory in this case I di assume that

1140
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,960
I didn't test I didn't do the theory

1141
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,180
testing so I stopped at with the

1142
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,180
inductive stage so the testability is

1143
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:13,160
that in this case mmm is a is a ver it

1144
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,220
is not so high because it is true that

1145
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,950
constructs are well-defined and the

1146
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,860
proposition are clear but on the other

1147
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,980
hand these are definitions are not

1148
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,760
numerical and the data collection was

1149
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,940
qualitative so I have I've done some

1150
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,420
open coding so I used strategies that

1151
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,880
are somewhat subjective so testability

1152
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,770
is limited and I could have different

1153
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:44,330
results okay empirical support seems to

1154
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,550
be seems to be good because for example

1155
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,680
I find other studies that seem to

1156
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,010
support my proposition explanatory power

1157
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,180
is also is also limited because

1158
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,110
motivations are derived from the

1159
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:00,290
interviews so the the reasons why have

1160
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,900
not been actually I didn't to consider

1161
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,420
all the possible variables that may have

1162
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:11,000
that may explain why okay parsimony yeah

1163
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,220
I can consider can give arguments that

1164
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,220
the number of constructs is limited the

1165
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,830
generality is a bit limited because my

1166
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,170
scope is related only to a field study

1167
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:24,530
in a specific company okay but the

1168
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,780
utility is very high because you can

1169
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,340
help this is you're making so if I am a

1170
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,080
cop funny I know that this very large

1171
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,320
company has used UML and it has affected

1172
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,480
the cost but it has improved the quality

1173
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,120
of documentation I can know what to do

1174
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,570
if I have money to invest and I know

1175
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:43,340
that in the long term using this

1176
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,100
language pays off and this is the

1177
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,620
written in a paper from a study of a

1178
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,390
large sized company that is comparable

1179
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,849
to mine this is extremely useful

1180
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:55,549
okay I don't have to take AI I can take

1181
00:57:55,549 --> 00:57:59,809
the risk of introducing you a man so hmm

1182
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,599
this theory maybe not so much supported

1183
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:06,049
not so much general but still very

1184
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:10,009
useful okay and these are all arguments

1185
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:11,960
that when you develop a theory when you

1186
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,819
do an implicit study like the one

1187
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:16,700
exemplified are all illogical arguments

1188
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,650
that have be to be checked by peers so

1189
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,749
you write these arguments that these are

1190
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:24,200
just words but the so called reviewers

1191
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,970
of your research will we check whether

1192
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:32,239
these arguments are sound okay so there

1193
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:34,849
is the there is a research community a

1194
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:37,999
set of other people that will read your

1195
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:42,109
arguments to support your theory and and

1196
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:45,890
will be allowed to evaluate your work

1197
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,759
okay
