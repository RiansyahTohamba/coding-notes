Problem yg di considered probability vs statistics saling berlawanan.

1. In probability theory we consider some underlying process which has some randomness or uncertainty modeled by random variables, and we figure out what happens. 
2. In statistics we observe something that has happened, and try to figure out what underlying process would explain those observations.

Induction vs Deduction? â€“ Paolo J
Like Paolo said, probability theory is mainly concerned with the deductive part, statistics with the inductive part of modeling processes with uncertainty. Perhaps it's interesting to mention that if one thinks that the plausible inductive reasoning should be consistent, then actually the result is bayesian statistics, and more interesting this can be derived from probability theory. So bayesian statistics is basically applied probability theory so to speak

I like the example of a jar of red and green jelly beans.

A probabilist starts by knowing the proportion of each and asks the probability of drawing a red jelly bean. A statistician infers the proportion of red jelly beans by sampling from the jar.

It's misleading to simply say that statistics is simply the inverse of probability. Yes, statistical questions are questions of inverse probability, but they are ill-posed inverse problems, and this makes a big difference in terms of how they are addressed.

Probability is a branch of pure mathematics--probability questions can be posed and solved using axiomatic reasoning, and therefore there is one correct answer to any probability question.

Statistical questions can be converted to probability questions by the use of probability models. Once we make certain assumptions about the mechanism generating the data, we can answer statistical questions using probability theory. HOWEVER, the proper formulation and checking of these probability models is just as important, or even more important, than the subsequent analysis of the problem using these models.

One could say that statistics comprises of two parts. The first part is the question of how to formulate and evaluate probabilistic models for the problem; this endeavor lies within the domain of "philosophy of science". The second part is the question of obtaining answers after a certain model has been assumed. This part of statistics is indeed a matter of applied probability theory, and in practice, contains a fair deal of numerical analysis as well.
