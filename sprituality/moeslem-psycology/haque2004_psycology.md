After more than a century of official existence…there is even debate of our subject matter… Staats and Koch agree that psychology’s splintered condition results, at least in part, and probably most importantly, from the existence of sharply polarized opinion about the epistemological underpinnings of psychology.




apa yang Jordan kritik tentang definisi psikologi?


Similarly, Jordan (1995) criticizes psychology by writing that, "There can be no doubt about it; contemporary American scientific psychology is the sterilest of the sterile. Years of arduous labor and the assiduous enterprise of hundreds of professors and thousands of students has yielded precisely 'nothing'.
the canard that 'psychology is a science' has long outlived its explanatory—away usefulness: the unpleasant and discouraging facts must be faced honestly" (p.3). 

Demikian pula, Jordan (1995) mengkritik psikologi dengan menulis bahwa, "Tidak ada keraguan tentang itu; psikologi ilmiah Amerika kontemporer adalah yang paling steril dari yang steril. Bertahun-tahun kerja keras dan usaha keras dari ratusan profesor dan ribuan siswa telah menghasilkan 'tidak ada' secara presisi.

desas-desus bahwa 'psychology is a science' telah lama hidup lebih lama dari penjelasannya—jauh dari kegunaannya: fakta-fakta yang tidak menyenangkan dan mengecewakan harus dihadapi dengan jujur" (hal.3).

pernyataan_x: 'psychology (yang selama ini sudah didefinsikan western) tidak benar-benar science'

pernyataan_x menjadikan saya untuk meng-eksplor why subject called science or not.

dan saya melihat yang paling dekat ada pada jawaban ini:

Prof David Ericson menyatakan:

There is no recipe to the “scientific method,” I’m afraid. We shouldn’t expect one, ever. For empirical phenomena, both in natural and social inquiry, the best we can do is 'increase the probabilities' and 'reduce the improbabilities' that our observations are accurate. 

inilah p-value jadi punya peran.
increase probability bahwa interaksi antara sebab-akibat itu selalu terjadi/akurat.
decrease probability bahwa interaksi antara sebab-akibat hanya kebetulan atau 'by chance'.


Lanjut prof ericson:
There is no special method that does that. At most, intersubjective agreement among specialists, at any particular time, is the most we can hope for; but future observations may lead to revision of our theories.

pernyataan kita bisa saja direvisi lagi.

This doesn’t mean that we are wallowing in subjectivity and relativism. It only means that at the frontier of any area of inquiry, there will be healthy disagreement among those who search for truth, which sometimes leads to upending our best theories at the time.

Social inquiry, however, has a double-hermeneutic (unlike natural inquiry). Social phenomena are pre-interpreted by ‘persons’ (however defined), while we think that natural phenomena are interpretation-free

Norager (1998) points out that experimental psychology and behaviorism have lived up to the standards of science, but as soon as psychology extend beyond these two positivistic realms, the ‘‘repressed past of philosophy and metaphysics immediately returns.’’



In view of these statements, we can see that modern psychology has not
quite lived up to its professional goals of helping individuals understand
themselves, the purpose and meaning of life, and how to live in a balanced and
constructive manner. 


Modern psychology makes grave assumptions that hu-
man behaviors are observable by the senses and therefore subject to quanti-
fication and measurement, while ignoring the transcendental aspect in man.
Humanity cannot always be measured in mechanical, materialistic and
reductionistic ways. Unlike the natural sciences, psychology studies human
behavior and cognitive processes, which include beliefs, attitudes, norms,
customs, and religious influences based on transcendental experiences and
value systems. Not studying these factors will give only partial picture of the
individual. 

`apa itu realm?`


Polkinghorne (1984) writes that the human realm is unique in terms of its:





An effort to understand human behavior will lead Muslim psychologists to adhere to the Islamic perspectives of human nature and this will mean taking them back into the history of their ancestors whose works were based on Islamic framework. 


Psychologists interested in the Islamic perspective need to
work both at the theoretical and practical levels to bring back their own indigenous psychology. 

indigenous = native = pribumi = aslinya


At the theoretical level, Muslim psychologists need to identify and clarify their worldview on knowledge in general and develop a
deeper insight into the nature and purpose of knowledge. 
This would entail clarifying Muslim core beliefs and understanding the distinction between secularism and Islam. 

entail = 'menyebabkan perlu'

Muslim psychologists develop deeper insight nature dan tujuan knowledge.
Ini menyebabkan perlunya klarifikasi core-belief dan pemahaman yang membedakan sekularis vs muslim.

They also need to redefine the subject matter of psychology from Islamic perspective using the Tawhidic paradigm—this would mean studying ‘‘Nafs’’ (soul), all over again, from a Muslim religious perspective. 




They also need to develop and expand the theoretical framework for all topics that come within the realm of Islamic psychology. At a more practical level, this would involve collecting materials of early to modern Muslim scholars relevant to psychology including translations from Arabic, French, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu into English for general readership. 



Perhaps an organization interested in such works should be identified. 

University grants, endowments and other private funds should be sought for financial support of this activity. 

They need to form a network of psychologists interested to coop-
erate in this venture. Muslim psychologists must learn, develop and then teach
Islamic psychology in all its comprehensiveness. 


Para psikologi muslim need to develop 'standardized scales' for the Muslim population, initiate empirical studies and Islamic ways of treating psychological problems addressing 
1. crisis counseling,
2. family counseling, 
3. school counseling and 
4. marital therapy
4 hal tersebut yang di adress dalam psikologi problem (Haque,2004)

Lalu, standared scale for muslim population entail that teknik yang dipakai untuk muslim pakistan dapat berlaku untuk muslim indonesia.
