# Component kode FB, Android OS itu open*
Much of the software that powers the world's largest companies, protects  our personal data, or encrypts national security information is open to  the public. 
# Component itu bisa digabung jadi new project
Anyone can download the source code behind Facebook's user  interface, Google's Android operating system or even Goldman Sachs' data  modeling program, and use it as a building block for a totally new  project.

What's more, lots of this software is actually developed  collaboratively, created and maintained by an army of thousands, from  unpaid volunteers to employees at competing tech companies.

# Kata anak desa itu  
"As a kid in a small town in Virginia, I could get connected to the best  developers anywhere on earth and learn from them and even read the code  that they'd written."

# Devon Zuegel (OSS Product Manager, Github)
"I really wanted to give back and these people were  always my heroes, so I wanted to participate too." 

# Chris Wright (CTO RedHat)
"And my voice mattered, it was just immediately, I was hooked."

This is the collaborative world of open-source software, where code is  written and shared freely.  If individuals catch a bug or see an opportunity for improvement, they can  suggest changes to the code and thereby become a contributor to some of  the biggest software projects on Earth.  

# OSS sudah benarkah ?
But this model hasn't always been the norm.  At the dawn of the Internet era through the late 1990s, proprietary  software proliferated.  Microsoft even went so far as to call open-source 1. un-American 
2. and bad for intellectual property rights.  

# Jim Zemlin 
"Software was a finite commodity that people hoarded and wanted to sell as  a product."

Open-source software was only developed and maintained by a  dedicated few. 
"And there was this fringe world, there was this academic  world who were creating software according to their own rules and sharing  it publicly and making it free."  

Certainly dreamed, like wouldn't it be awesome if we could sort of take  over the world? Now, open-source has, essentially, taken over the world.  Companies in every industry from Walmart to ExxonMobil to Verizon have  open-sourced their projects.
