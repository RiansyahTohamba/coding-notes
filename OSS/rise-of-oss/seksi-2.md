Microsoft has completely changed its point of view and is now seen as a leader in the space.  And in 2016, the U.S. government even promised to open-source at least 20 percent of all its  new, custom developed code.  So whether you know it or not, you are relying on the volunteer labor in  many cases of thousands of strangers from around the world.  In the 1970s, the M.I.T  Artificial Intelligence Lab had a printer that regularly jammed.  So staff programmer, Richard Stallman, altered its source code, so that  when problems arose it would send a message to everyone in the lab saying,  "Go fix the printer." When the lab finally got a new printer, Stallman  discovered its source code was inaccessible.  He asked for the code, got refused, got upset and ultimately quit his job  to develop a completely open operating system called GNU, in 1983.  With this, Stallman spearheaded the free software movement from which the  open-source movement was born.  It's sort of a very natural way to work together.  Collectively, if everybody comes and contributes their piece, you end up  with something that's a lot greater than something that an individual  could contribute on their own. But throughout the 1980s and the 1990s,  proprietary software is still dominated.  And that was a very lucrative way of producing and selling software, and  created an incentive for large technology companies to create a  proprietary de facto standard.  It was against this backdrop that the open-source operating system Linux  was unceremoniously released in 1991.  It incorporated many elements from Stallman's GNU project, but was mainly  used by hobbyists looking for an alternative to Windows or MacOS.  Throughout the decade though, Linux gained momentum as large companies  took advantage of its flexibility and tweaked the software to their  specific needs. By the turn of the century, NASA, Dell and IBM were all  using it.

The platform itself changes nine times an hour.  

Ten thousand lines of code are added to Linux every day. 

About five thousand lines are changed and about eight thousand lines are  removed. 

It is by far the highest velocity, most effective software  development process in the history of computing. 

As Linux grew, other open-source projects were also gaining popularity,  like the database management system MySQL, the Perl programming language  and the web server Apache. 

But for the layperson at the turn of the century, the rise of these  technologies could have gone unnoticed. 

After all, hardly anyone ran Linux on their personal computers. 

But then in 2008, Google released Android devices, which run on a modified  version of Linux. Suddenly, the operating system blew up the smartphone  market. We are still overwhelmed with the amount of innovation that is  happening in that ecosystem of Android.  Today, there are over 2.5  billion active devices using Android.  As Google demonstrated, businesses were increasingly relying upon this  complex web of open-source technologies to build products and platforms  quickly. And whether they knew it or not, this also meant that they were  depending upon the vast open-source community to maintain this software.  The ability for one company to produce the amount of software that's  required for any modern technology, product or service became  overwhelming. Today, in a modern luxury automobile, there are more lines  of software code than in an F-15 fighter jet.  

There's just simply too much software to be written for any single  organization to write it themselves.  

Ninety nine percent of Fortune 500 companies use open-source.  

Every web server is pretty much Linux.  Most people choose to use open-source programming languages.  It's this like amazing buffet.  You just come in and take this, this, this, this and you slap together  something. You can build, you know, amazingly powerful products with very  little work. The sheer increase in volume drove a need amongst developers  for a central repository where they could collaborate on these huge  projects. 

And in 2008, GitHub provided an answer. 

What GitHub really did for open-source is it kind of standardized the way  that people can contribute to open-source projects and interface with  them. 

And so that any developer, anywhere on earth knew how to contribute  to a project on GitHub.  And that fed this explosion of open-source activity.  Today, Github hosts the grand majority of the world's open-source software  projects. And in 2018, Microsoft even acquired GitHub, affirming the tech giant's commitment to open-source development.
