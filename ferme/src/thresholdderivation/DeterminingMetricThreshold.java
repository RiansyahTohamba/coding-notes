			// Respect to metrics defined in ℝ or ℕ, we first pool and aggregate the measurement data for different software systems. 
			// Then we derive five different thresholds that 
			// (i) respect the statistical properties of the metric, i.e., its distribution and 
			// (ii) help focusing on the most interesting values.

		// The defined properties are often in the form of "identify classes that have LOW cohesion" or "identify methods that have a VERY-HIGH complexity". 

		// We want to derive thresholds in a way that they can be semantically mapped to these informal requirements, to find out what LOW cohesion or VERY-HIGH complexity means in terms of the metrics we use to measure cohesion and complexityof the software system.


		void fiveThreshold(){
			// With this need in mind, we compute, for each metric, a set of five thresholds that identifies five points on the metrics distribution, for BBTs, and five points among common fractions for CFTs.
			// We define a threshold using three attributes:
			//  a name or label;
			//  a corresponding percentile (for BBT), or a corresponding common fraction (for CFT);
			//  a type.
			// We use the name to refer to a threshold with a semantic meaning. 
			// The names we use for the five thresholds are:  VERY-LOW, LOW, MEAN, HIGH, VERY-HIGH. VERY-LOW represents the lowest threshold, while VERY-HIGH the highest one. 
			// We call VERY-LOW and VERY-HIGH extreme thresholds.		
		}

		// The corresponding percentile, or 𝑇ℎ𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡, is the point on the reference set of points (i.e., the percentiles of the metrics distribution) representing where to find the value for the given threshold (i.e., 𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒).

		// common fractions, that represents where to find the value for CFTs (i.e.,

			// Each threshold is mapped to a value by the function 𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑂𝑓(𝑇ℎ𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡).  	𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒  is the threshold used for comparing other values of the metric. As part of our code smells detection approach, described in Chapter 6, we offer to the user the possibility of hardening or softening thresholds values. Hardening or softening threshold values is useful because of the difficulty to generalize the obtained thresholds to all the possible software systems; we offer to the user the possibility of moving thresholds to achieve more or less strict constraints. The type allows us to define different typologies of thresholds for each name/label, based on the selection we do in these sense.

			// We define three possible types of thresholds: 
			defaultVal();
			harden();
			soften();
				
			// When we set Harden and Soften, we have to refer to the characteristics of the metric and to the property of the system we want to measure, to understand if they have a direct or inverse correlation. 
			// To select properly the threshold we refer always to the definition we give in Appendix B2, in particularly to the "Worse" attribute, and to the detection strategies we define for each code smell in Chapter 6. 
			// As for example, consider the LOC metric and a generic 𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 corresponding to the HIGH threshold. 
			// If we want to capture "class with a HIGH number of lines of code", 
			// we can compare LOC and 𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 using: 𝐿𝑂𝐶 ≥ 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑂𝑓(HIGH). 
			// Hardening the threshold in this situation means that we have to select a greater 𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 for the HIGH threshold, so that the number of entities that exceeds the threshold can be reduced. 
			// Conversely, if we want to capture "class with a LOW number of lines of code", we can compare LOC to the 𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 corresponding to the LOW threshold: 𝐿𝑂𝐶 ≤ 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑂𝑓(𝐿𝑂𝑊). Here hardening the threshold means that we have to select a lower 𝑇ℎ𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 for the LOW threshold, so that the number of entities that exceeds the threshold can be reduced.
