# Chapter 1 
Chapter 1 presents a brief introduction to statistics, presenting its two branches of descriptive and inferential statistics, and a short history of the subject and some of the people whose early work provided a foundation for work done today.

# Chapter 2
The subject matter of descriptive statistics is then considered in Chapter 2. Graphs and tables that describe a data set are presented in this chapter, as are quantities that are used to summarize certain of the key properties of the data set.

# Chapter 3
To be able to draw conclusions from data, it is necessary to have an understanding of the data’s origination. For instance, it is often assumed that the data constitute a "random sample" from some population. To understand exactly what this means and what its consequences are for relating properties of the sample data to properties of the entire population, it is necessary to have some understanding of probability, and that is the subject of Chapter 3. This chapter introduces the idea of a probability experiment, explains the concept of the probability of an event, and presents the axioms of probability.

# Chapter 4, 5, 6
## Introduction RV and Expectation
Our study of probability is continued in Chapter 4, which deals with the important concepts of random variables and expectation, 
## Special RV
and in Chapter 5, which considers some specialtypes of random variables that often occur in applications. 
## Kind of RV
Chapter 6 isinya Kind of RV including 
{the binomial, Poisson, hypergeometric, normal, uniform, gamma, chi-square, t, and F}

We study the probability distribution of such sampling statistics as the sample mean and the sample variance. 

Teori 'central limit theorem' digunakan untuk estimasi  probability distribution of the sample mean.

2. joint probability distribution of sample mean 
3. joint probability distribution of sample variance

in the important special case in which the underlying data come from a normally distributed population.

"how to use data to estimate parameters of interest." 
Contohnya, scientist tertarik dengan 
proportion danau cikarang yang dipengaruhi hujan asam.

2 jenis estimators dipelajari.

1. estimator A : estimate exactly single number (for instance, it might estimate that 47 percent danau cikarang terkena acid rain), 
sementara 
2. estimator B : estimate interval of number (interval 45-49 percent danau cikarang terkena acid rain). 

Estimator B provide "level of confidence" validitas dari modelnya. 

Thus, for instance, whereas we can be pretty certain that the exact percentage of afflicted lakes is not 47, it might very well be that we can be, say, 95 percent confident that the actual percentage is between 45 and 49.

# Chapter 8
Pengenalan NHST which is concerned with using data to test the plausibility of a specified hypothesis. 
Misal suatu test might reject the hypothesis that 
'fewer than 44 percent of danau cikarang are afflicted by acid rain.'
NSHT reject that (x < 44/100) == TRUE

The concept of the p-value, which measures the degree of plausibility of the hypothesis after the data have been observed, is introduced. 
A variety of hypothesis tests concerning the parameters of both one and two normal populations are considered.
Hypothesis tests concerning Bernoulli and Poisson parameters are also presented.

# Chapter 9 
Chapter 9 deals with the important topic of regression. Both simple linear regression — including such subtopics as regression to the mean, residual analysis, and
weighted least squares — and multiple linear regression are considered.

# Chapter 10
Chapter 10 introduces the analysis of variance. Both one-way and two-way (with
and without the possibility of interaction) problems are considered.

# Chapter 11
Bab 11 membahas tentang uji coba yang goodness, yang dapat digunakan untuk menguji apakah model yang diusulkan konsisten dengan data.
Di dalamnya kami menyajikan uji kesesuaian chi-square klasik dan menerapkannya untuk menguji independensi dalam tabel kontingensi. 
Bagian terakhir dari bab ini memperkenalkan prosedur Kolmogorov-Smirnov untuk menguji apakah data berasal dari specified 'distribusi probabilitas kontinu' .

# Chapter 12
Chapter 12 deals with nonparametric hypothesis tests, which can be used when one is unable to suppose that the underlying distribution has some specified parametric
form (such as normal).

# Chapter 13
Chapter 13 considers the subject matter of quality control, a key statistical technique in manufacturing and production processes. 
A variety of control charts, including not only the Shewhart control charts but also more sophisticated ones based on moving averages and cumulative sums, are considered.

# Chapter 14
Chapter 14 deals with problems related to life testing. In this chapter, the exponential, rather than the normal, distribution plays the key role.

# Chapter 15
In Chapter 15, we consider 
1. the statistical inference techniques of bootstrap statistical methods and 
2. permutation tests. 

We first show how probabilities can be obtained by simulation and then how to utilize simulation in these statistical inference approaches.
