frequency interpretation vs subjective interpretation
frequency interpretation
In the frequency interpretation, the probability of a given outcome of an experiment is considered as being a "property" of that outcome. 
nilai dari probabilitas ada nya oil ditentukan by continual repetition of the experiment — the probability of the outcome will then be observable as being the proportion of the experiments that result in the outcome. 

continual_repetition_of_the_experiment = 10 times, 100 times ,1M times
proporsi_experiments = observable_oil / (observable_oil + unobservable_oil)

This is the interpretation of probability that is most prevalent among scientists.

Pendapat kedua subjective interpration of probability, based on someone belief, dipakai di filosofi dan decision maker ekonomi.
--
Regardless of which interpretation one gives to probability, however, there is a consensus 
the mathematics of probability (frequency) ==the mathematics of probability (subjective)

i think 
probability rain tommorow = 3/10 
probability cloudy without any rain = 2/10
then
probability cloudy or rainy = 5/10 
independently of your individual interpretation of the concept of probability (frequency or subjective). 

# sample space and event
ruang sample dan kejadian
sample itu dari statistic
event itu dari probability
outcome experiment sifatnya random tapi (biasanya) kita sudah mengetahui possible outcome nya (lemparan koin,dadu etc) atau experiment refactoring (improving or not affect quality).

saya hanya melakkan eksperimen refactoring 29 kali pada satu software.
Bagaimana menyatakan refactoring dilakukan 29 kali?
untuk menghilangkan 1 smell, butuh berapa kali refactoring?

# axioms of probability

1. 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1
P(E) berada di interval 0 sampai 1

2. P(S) = 1
Bisa dipastikan bahwa hasil yang keluar dari experiment adalah member dari sample space S.

3. P(E)
Axiom 3 states that for any set of mutually exclusive events the probability that at least one of these events occurs is equal to the sum of their respective probabilities.
It should be noted that if we interpret P(E) as the relative frequency of the event E
when a large number of repetitions of the experiment are performed, then P(E) would indeed satisfy the above axioms. 

For instance, 
1. the proportion (or frequency) of time that the outcome is in E is clearly between 0 and 1, 
2. and the proportion of time that it is in S is 1 (since all outcomes are in S ). 
3. Also, if E and F have no outcomes in common, then the proportion of time that the outcome is in either E or F is the sum of their respective frequencies. 
Contoh dari statement ke-3 

The rolling of a pair of dice and suppose that 

E = event that the sum is 2, 3, or 12 and 
F = event that the sum is 7 or 11. 

Then if outcome E occurs 11 percent of the time 
and outcome F 22 percent of the time, 
then 33 percent of the time the outcome will be either 2, 3, 12, 7, or 11.

Ada kejadian F dan E yang tak eksklusif.
