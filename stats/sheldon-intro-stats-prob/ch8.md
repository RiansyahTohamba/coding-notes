hal 359-418
1. manufacturer create hypothesis that his product which is cable have strengths at least 7,000 psi, jika dibuat persamaan matematika nya berarti = (mean >= 7,000 pounds per square inch.)
2. konsumen menguji hipotesis tersebut. terima atau tolak?
H0 : the population mean is BELOW 7,000 pounds per square inch.
H1 : the population mean is at least 7,000 pounds per square inch.
cara menguji nya dengan mengambil random sample.
10 sample cable yg random dari large suplly cable punya kekuatan 7k psi 
To verify this claim, the firm has decided to take a random sample of 10 of these cables to determine their breaking strengths. 

apakah H0 ditolak?
"parameter of population distribution"
paramaters = ['??','??','??']

A statistical hypothesis is usually a statement about a set of parameters of a population distribution.
