This paper reports on a systematic literature review conducted to identify measures that are
obtainable from source code of object-oriented programs and to investigate their links with
quality as reported in empirical studies. Primary studies are traced to five external quality
attributes: reliability, maintainability, effectiveness and functionality.
Results from our systematic literature review suggest that there is an overwhelming number of studies that can be traced to reliability compared to other external quality attributes.
More investigations on studies on other quality attributes would be helpful to understand the
link between internal properties of object-oriented programs and various aspects of quality.
70 % of the primary studies were traced to reliability and 31 % of the studies were traced to
maintainability; whilst studies traced to (or considered as surrogates for) effectiveness and
functionality constituted of 1 % of the primary studies.
According to the vote-counting results, measures for complexity, cohesion, coupling
and size show better consistency on their relationship with reliability and maintainability
attributes across the primary studies than inheritance. Measures that quantify inheritance
properties show poor links to reliability and maintainability.

Though inheritance measures are used in some of the prediction models found in reliability and maintainability studies, there is evidence that models that do not include these measures are useful as well. 
Thus the usefulness of inheritance measures maybe more context dependent than measures of other
properties.

In summary, a meaningful analysis could only be performed for reliability and maintainability, because there were too few studies traced to effectiveness and functionality.
Measures that quantify complexity, cohesion, coupling and size can be useful indicators for
reliability and maintainability during quality assessment activities for object-oriented systems. Using regression and machine learning methods, a combination of all or a subset of
these measures can be used to predict reliability and maintainability related concerns. Measures that quantify other properties, such as inheritance and cohesion, show poor links to
reliability and maintainability.
For future work we urge researchers to diversify the types of external quality
attributes that they investigate. As highlighted in the previous paragraph, there are very
few studies that can be traced to external quality attributes other than reliability and
maintainability. Quality is a multifaceted concept, and practitioners would be interested
in understanding the link between object-oriented measures and a wider range of external quality attributes. Another possible future work would be to investigate the consistency
of the relation between measures and quality attributes across certain types or sizes of
datasets.
It is also important to enable other researchers to validate ones work and findings. For
this reason, Catal and Diri (2009) emphasized the need to use publicly available data to
enable the research community to validate and compare each others’ findings. In our review,
we found that just 57 % (out of 99) of the primary studies used publicly available datasets.
In similar vein as (Catal and Diri 2009), we would therefore like to urge researchers to use
publicly available datasets in their empirical studies. We should point out that we are not
proposing to neglect private datasets. But rather urging the use of publicly available datasets,
which can be done together in the same study with private datasets. This would make it
easier to compare findings from different settings.
Model validation results were seldom found in the primary studies. Lack of this information makes it difficult to determine usefulness of a model or how successful a prediction
model was/is in a given study. Riaz et al. (2009) reported a similar finding and concern for
prediction models found in maintainability studies.
Measures such as the C&K measures have been extensively investigated. More studies
using these measures may not add much to the body of knowledge. Perhaps, a metaanalysis could be performed specifically on the usefulness of the C&K measures. To
enrich the body of knowledge future studies should make an effort to investigate other
sets of measurement suites. We see a need to empirically investigate other measures,
since there are many source code measures that have not been sufficiently investigated
empirically.
There are some measures that show a significant relationship with external quality
attributes in one direction in some outcomes but are not significant in a large number of outcomes. This could be an indicator that some measures might be suitable in
certain contexts only, e.g., certain characteristics in a system. This may need further
