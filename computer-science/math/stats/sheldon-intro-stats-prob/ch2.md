Dataset normal 
Larget dataset pada akhirnya kurva normal yakni membentuk kurva lonceng, banyak data akan berpusat di mediannya dan sisanya di kedua sisi.

If the histogram of a data set is close to being a normal histogram, then we say that the data set is approximately normal.

# 6. Paired dataset and sample correlation coeficients

We are often concerned with data sets that consist of pairs of values that have some relationship to each other. If each element in such a data set has an x value and a y value,
then we represent the ith data point by the pair (xi,yi). For instance, in an attempt to
determine the relationship between the daily midday temperature (measured in degrees
Celsius) and the number of defective parts produced during that day, a company recorded
the data presented in Table 2.8. For this data set, xi represents the temperature in degrees
Celsius and yi the number of defective parts produced on day i.
A useful way of portraying a data set of paired values is to plot the data on a twodimensional graph, with the x-axis representing the x value of the data and the y-axis
representing the y value. Such a plot is called a scatter diagram. 

Figure 2.13 presents a scatter diagram for the data of Table 2.8.

A question of interest concerning paired data sets is whether large x values tend to be paired with largey values, and small x values with smally values; if this is not the case, then we might question whether large values of one of the variables tend to be paired
with small values of the other. 

A rough answer to these questions can often be provided by the scatter diagram. 

For instance, Figure 2.13 indicates that there appears to be some connection between high temperatures and large numbers of defective items. 

To obtain a quantitative measure of this relationship, we now develop a statistic that attempts to measure the degree to which larger x values go with larger y values and smaller x values with smaller y values.
