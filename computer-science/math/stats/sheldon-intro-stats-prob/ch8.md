hypothesis testing
hal 359-418
# notes
vektor parameter = [mean,variance]
# intro
Melanjutkan chapter sebelumnya, misalkan
Sebuah random sample dari sebuah distribution population dimana
random sample sudah di beri nilai 
kecuali nilai vektor parameter yang tidak diketahui
dan  random sample itu harus diamati ! wkwkw napa sih.
Ma


However, rather than wishing to explicitly estimate the unknown parameters, let us now suppose that we are primarily concerned with using the resulting sample to test some particular hypothesis concerning them. As an illustration, suppose that a construction firm has just purchased a large supply of cables that have been guaranteed to have an average breaking strength of at least 7,000 psi. 

To verify this claim, the firm has decided to take a random sample of 10 of these cables to determine their breaking strengths. They will then use the result of this experiment to ascertain whether or not they accept the cable manufacturerâ€™s hypothesis that the population mean is at least 7,000 pounds per square inch.

1. manufacturer create hypothesis that his product which is cable have strengths at least 7,000 psi, jika dibuat persamaan matematika nya berarti = (mean >= 7,000 pounds per square inch.)
2. konsumen menguji hipotesis tersebut. terima atau tolak?

H0 : the population mean is BELOW 7,000 pounds per square inch.
H1 : the population mean is at least 7,000 pounds per square inch.
cara menguji nya dengan mengambil random sample.
10 sample cable yg random dari large suplly cable punya kekuatan 7k psi 
To verify this claim, the firm has decided to take a random sample of 10 of these cables to determine their breaking strengths. 

apakah H0 ditolak?
"parameter of population distribution"
paramaters = ['??','??','??']

A statistical hypothesis is usually a statement about a set of parameters of a population distribution. 
It is called a hypothesis because it is not known whether or not it is true.
hypothesis = true? or hypothesis = false?
