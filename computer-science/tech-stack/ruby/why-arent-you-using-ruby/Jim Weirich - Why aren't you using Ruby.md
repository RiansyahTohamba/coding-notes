good morning again okay let's get this

started you excited to be here all right

very good

ah before I start my talk I want to

start off with some fun okay so I want

to show you guys the latest toy that we

have back in the office so if you see

right here this is a flying drone that's

remote-controlled this is a this is

actually Karen's drone that's flying I'm

filming this from my drone so we have

two drones actually flying in the office

right there there's Karen right there at

the edge we're trying to do the thing

where we're practicing flying so she's

going to fly around the room and I'm

going to fly so my camera points at her

all the time

lost in the lights there we go it's

coming out there I tell you this is

great fun it's it's really weird to see

people walking through our hallways at

the office and looking up and seeing

what's going on with us but so far

everybody's been very positive no one's

tried to get us kicked out because we're

flying drones but this is this is this

is awesome stuff and you just have great

fun I'm not going to make you watch the

entire video I'm going to skip ahead

here and I'll show you what happens when

your drone runs out of batteries so

there yeah about right here maybe okay

so I'm I'm filming and going around all

of a sudden I get a little bit wobbly

with my drone and there we go okay

lesson watch the battery meter when

you're flying okay, 

so that's the fun part we'll have more fun too, 
but I thought we just start off with that. 

# introduction
hi I'm Jim Wyrick.
I'm with neo.
and I'm here to talk about 'why you should be using Ruby'

now I think so I'm going to I'm going to

try to convince you that Ruby is a cool
language to use and that you should be
using it then and if you're not already.

how many people are here using Ruby?
already ok quite enough. 

how many people here are curious about Ruby and they
aren't using it yet? 

ok quite a number of you 
you are the guys I want to talk to 

I want to tell you about Ruby and get you excited about (maybe) using it. 

now there's a downside to doing talks like this.

and I think us as programmers fall into this trap a lot.
there's features versus benefits and when I talk about features if I talk about Ruby.
