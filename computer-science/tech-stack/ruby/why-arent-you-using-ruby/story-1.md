cerita pertama: jim switch ke ruby.

and the first story is 'about me switching to Ruby' in the first place. 
only people recognize this code. what language, Perl? yes Perl!

so I was I was using Perl at the time, this would have been the year 2000, probably in the spring. 

Jim use Perl pada 2000,musim spring. 

I've been using Perl,for about 3 years, to do a lot of scripting. 
I was a C++ programmer at the time. 
just learning Java during this time period. 

I use Perl to write a lot of the scripts that I use to manage my process to generate header files.

to find things in files sort things out just all the tools that every programmer uses to get things done.

I was writing my stuff in Perl. 
now Perl is a wonderful language to get things done quickly in. 

and I really really loved it for that.

## downside menggunakan perl
but there's a big downside to using Perl.

and I found that as my programs grew larger and larger
the Perl code became harder and harder.

scalability nya, perl semakin besar size nya semakin sulit dipahami.

but as soon as you need a list of
a list things get a little strange in  Perl in fact I would like to point out  that in the Perl tutorial page there's a  separate document just talking about how  to write a list of a list and it is  called Perl lol not saying anything but  okay so I was using Perl I was really  really really looking for something  better so I surveyed the landscape and  in the year 2000 there wasn't much else  out there but I stumble along this other  language called Python good Python looks  like it's exactly what I need it's  object oriented which is something I  really really liked if you ever tried to  do object orientation in Perl Oh haven't  helped you it was a scripting language  and it was freely available to all the  criteria I needed so I grabbed Python I  started using it the immediate downside  I found is that where I could write  stuff very very very quickly in Perl to  do it in Python required me to go back  to the documentation and read how do I  read a file how do I do this how do I do  that and every single thing I needed to  do I had to look up and learn and so the  learning curve moving from pearl to  Python was rather steep for me in fact  it was steep enough I tried three  separate times to learn Python and gave  up two times the third time I was  determined I am going to learn this  language or else so I sat down I started  doing stuff with it and I was reading  the documentation and I was I was really  getting you know into Python and 

I was really going to learn it and then I was reading a mailing list I think it was the extreme programming mailing list so
because XP was
in the year 2000 that was kind of when
it was kicking off and I was reading
that mailing list and there was a email
on that list from this fella: Dave Thomas, 
who wrote the 'pickaxe book'.

but at the time the only book he had written was the pragmatic programmer
which I had just finished reading. 
have you read this book? 
awesome book, if you have not read this book yet, 
please go out and pick it up.

it is full of really
great pragmatic advice for developers I

really highly recommend it so I said oh

look here's an email from Dave Thomas

and I really respect him because of the

book he wrote here and the email he said

hey guys I discovered this little

language called Ruby it's kind of cool

you might like it that's all he said I

thought well. 

if Dave Thomas likes Ruby I'm going to check it out
so I downloaded Ruby I booted it up
booted it up I started it up and I
started taking a look at it and in two

days

I totally switched from Perl to Ruby

after two days I wrote no more new code

in Perl after that point I switched over

was so easy for me every time I got to a

place where I said I need to do

something I would think about oh let's

see Perl doesn't like this if I would

take that and do it in a way I would do

it like this and bam it worked.

so Ruby really matched match my expectations of

the language it was an awesome experience and I love Ruby ever since
that so I've been using Ruby now, thirteen years getting really close to

thirteen years now so awesome awesome

awesome language. 

so let's summarize this story: 
1. least surprise

Ruby has what we call the 'principle of least surprise'.

things in there if you know the language and kind of knows know where it's going this thing's did it
tend to be unsurprising you think hmm

how would I do this and doggone it it

seems to work

it has great data abstraction where Perl

had trouble managing 'lists of lists'

ada case 'list of list' yang tak bisa ditangani perl 

Ruby

could easily handle lists of anything

and it was just objects and everything

was uniformly accessed through through

message passing and 

it was so strong strongly OO. 

in fact it's probably the

most low language out there in the same

class as small talk so a really strong

ability 

and easy to learn I found it
quite easy to pick up and go with it

I teach rails programming now to people

new to rails and most of the people in

the class are also new to Ruby we teach

them rails and Ruby in a three day

course and they come out of that with a

pretty good foundation on how to do

programming in rails even though that

might be the first time they've seen

Ruby Ruby is not a hard language to pick up.



## summary 
1. banyak merujuk ke pick axe nya dave thomas
2. easy to learn: kecepatan orang lain untuk belajar ruby
3. oo way
