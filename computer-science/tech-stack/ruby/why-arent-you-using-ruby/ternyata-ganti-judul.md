# penjelasan singkat fitur dari ruby
I'd love to tell you about the blocks in Ruby.
how we can use anonymous blocks do all kinds of
wonderful things.

I can talk about the 'strong oo messaging' in Ruby.

and how great that is I can tell you that Ruby
is a dynamic language.

I can tell you about the testing culture that comes
along with a community of Ruby.

but these are all features of the language: 
what you really want to hear or 
what are the benefits to you for using Ruby. 


# ganti judul conference menjadi: why I use Ruby

so I'm  not going to talk a lot about the features of Ruby. 
instead I'm going to tell some stories so maybe a better name for this talk instead of 'why aren't you using Ruby' is 'why I use Ruby'.

## Ternyata...
Judul ruby-conference ini seharusnya `why Jim use ruby?` 
hehe...

so we're going to go from there, 
I'm going to tell you: 
"5 stories about some Ruby code", that I've written in the past that I get excited about and I really love.
