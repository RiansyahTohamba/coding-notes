# how-to-read
Spring in Action, Fourth Edition is divided into four parts. 

The first part introduces you to the essentials of the Spring Framework. 

Part 2 expands on that by showing how to build web applications with Spring. 

Part 3 steps behind the front end and shows where Spring fits in the back end of an application. 

The final part shows how Spring can be used to integrate with other applications and services.

# part 1
In part 1, you’ll explore the Spring container, dependency injection ( DI ), and aspect-oriented programming…the essentials of the Spring Framework. 

This will give you a foundation upon which the rest of the book will build.


In chapter 1, you’ll be given an overview of Spring, including some basic examples of DI and AOP . You’ll also get an overview of the greater Spring ecosystem.


Chapter 2 goes into more detail with DI, showing you various ways that the components in your application (the "beans") can be wired together. 

This includes wiring with XML , Java, and automatic wiring.

With the basics of bean wiring down, chapter 3 presents several advanced wiring techniques. 


You won’t need these techniques that often, but when you do need
them this chapter will show you how to get the most power out of the Spring
container.
Chapter 4 explores how to use Spring AOP to decouple cross-cutting concerns
from the objects that they service. This chapter also sets the stage for later chap-
ters where you’ll use AOP to provide declarative services such as transactions,
security, and caching.

# part 2
Chapter 5 covers the basics of working with Spring MVC , the foundational web
framework in Spring. You’ll see how to write controllers to handle web requests
and respond with model data.
Once a controller is finished with its work, the model data must be rendered using a view. 


Chapter 6 will explore various view technologies that can be used with Spring, including JSP, Apache Tiles, and Thymeleaf.



Chapter 7 goes beyond the basics of Spring MVC . In this chapter, you’ll learn how to customize Spring MVC configuration, handle multipart file uploads, deal with exceptions that may occur in a controller, and pass data between requests with flash attributes.



Chapter 8 explores Spring Web Flow, an extension to Spring MVC that enables development of conversational web applications. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to build web applications that lead the user through a specific, guided flow.

In chapter 9 you’ll learn how to apply security to the web layer of your application using Spring Security.
