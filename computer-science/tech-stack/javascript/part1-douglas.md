so I'm going to begin by introducing you

to this guy this is Antoine de

saint-exup√©ry he was a French aviator

aviator is the word that we used to use

for pilot back when aviation was really

dangerous and it was really dangerous

because the planes crashed a lot he

experienced several crashes during his

career and survived almost all of them

he is once trying to set a speed record

from Paris to Saigon but his plane

crashed in the sahara desert just

outside of Cairo and he was not prepared

for desert survival so he suffered

terrible dehydration as a result of that

he stopped sweating which in the desert

is a really dangerous thing he had awful

hallucinations fortunately he was

rescued by someone who knew how to treat

severe dehydration and he recovered Wow

World War two was starting so he went

into exile in America where he became a

writer it turns out he was a really good

writer he is best remembered for having

written the little prince which is a

famous children's book it's about an

aviator who was stranded in the desert

who was was visited by a strange little

boy who lives on an asteroid and his

suicidal like all the great children's

books it's not really a children's book

he also wrote books for adults and in

one of them he wrote what I think is one

of the best sentences ever written he

said it seems that perfection is

attained not when there is nothing more

to add but when there is nothing more to

take away he was writing about the

design of airplanes but it seems to talk

about everything which combines

discipline and creativity and I hear

this quote being used all the time from

in architecture and design and

everything but I think it has a

particular application to programming

because we have this real connection

with perfection more than any other

craft our programs have to be perfect if

our programs are not perfect in every

way dad things happen and he gives us

some insight as to how perfection is

attained it's not by adding things it's

by taking things away and it occurred to

me that this should also apply to

programming languages that we can make

our programming languages better by

taking away things so that leads to the

idea of good parts where a language can

be made better not by adding things but

by removing things and the principle of

good parts says that if a feature is

sometimes useful and sometimes dangerous

and if there is a better option then

always use the better option I think

this makes a lot of sense a lot of

people still think this is controversial

that you can't make me use the better

option which seems like an odd argument

to make but there's still a lot of

people saying that and I think it comes

from a fundamental misunderstanding of

what it is that we're doing here we are

not paid to use every feature of the

language at the end of a project there

isn't a manager with a clipboard saying

did you use a-plus-plus did you leave

out any semicolons excellent no that's

not what they're looking for we are paid

to write programs that work well and are

free of error now free of error when did

that become part of the deal

well it turns out it has always been a

part of the deal it it's the most

important part it's just that we attain

it so rarely that it's easy to forget

that that's the most important thing

about what we're doing so my advice to

everybody who wants to be a better

programmer is to learn more languages

because a good program good programming

language should teach you and in my

career the language which has taught me

the most was JavaScript

I had a very difficult relationship

relationship with JavaScript because in

the beginning I made every mistake with

JavaScript you can make starting with

the first one the worst one I started

programming without bothering to learn

the language first and I I thought I

could get away with that because it

looked familiar I thought I understood

how it worked and it punished me for

that it punished me hard eventually I

decided to read the standard and try to

figure out what the language actually

did and that completely changed my

understanding of this language it was

not at all what I had thought of at

first it was actually a very different

actually a very good language but until

I read the standard I had no idea that

was true now even though it's a very

good language it's a language that

contains a lot of bad parts and to help

me manage those bad parts I wrote a

program called jeaious lint everybody

should be using jeaious lint you know

all of your code everything should pass

chance lint because it's important for

us to write good stuff and this is the

best way to assure that it's good and

when I started writing jeaious lint

I had no idea about programming style I

didn't think style was important I was

just looking for errors but jeaious lint

taught me that programming style is

actually very important that increasing

the visual distance between a good

program and a bad one is one of the most

effective ways we have to avoid making

mistakes so turns out chance lint is a

lot smarter about javascript than I am

it taught me more than I taught it so I

wrote my own book about my adventures

with JavaScript and giant called

javascript the good parts anyone heard

of this one yeah a few hands go up so

it's still a best-seller in its category

which is really unusual

most software books are obsolete at the

time that the printed in this one has

been out for 10 years and is still doing

really well and I think that's because

it turned out what I identified as good

parts we're mostly right and

so there's still value in the book that

said I'm working on another book and I'm

hoping to get it out for you this year

and in the process of going through it

it gave me a chance to sort of

re-evaluate and decide what actually is

good and what is not there is still an

argument though about good parts that

there are some people who think that

that concept doesn't apply to them

so I'd like to review some of the

arguments about why we shouldn't care

about the good parts the first one is

it's just a matter of opinion you say

it's bad I say it's good all opinions

are equally valid that turns out not to

be true that and the reason I say that

is so I'm the maintainer of Janice Lynch

and I get reports from people from all

over the world an occasion I get

something from someone who says we've

just spent two bloody weeks chasing down

some weird thing that turned out to be

an obscure corner case in JavaScript

that none of us had ever heard of and it

really was expensive to find this thing

could you please put a test in to Janice

lint so that no one will ever experience

that again and if their request makes

sense I put it in which means that if

you're using jeaious lint that will

never happen to you

that's not an opinion that is a fact

every feature is an essential tool I

need to be able to use every tool in the

tool sets in order to do my work it

turns out that's not true

that you can do better work with just

the good parts with just the good tools

you don't need to use the tools that are

rusted or have broken handles if you can

do better work without a broken tool

then that tool was not essential but a

feature is sometimes useful
