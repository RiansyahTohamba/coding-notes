### Sw-Eng AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE
tentang apa sih?
1. objective : sw-eng vs other-science-discipline
other-science-discipline = obtaining new knowledge for 'solution' corresponding problems
while 
sw-eng = obtaining new knowledge which is theory of 'construction of programs', production-oriented, obtaining result from product(program).

2. The science of SE includes 
'theoretical and formal methods' and 
'tools for construction software' 

3. Construction consists of analysis of an object domain and design and formation of an output code to be executed on a computer.

#### Basic concepts and objects

include data and their structures, functions and compositions, 

basic objects (modules, components, skeletons, reusable components (RUCs), etc.), and 

target objects (SS, program systems, families of systems, software projects, complicated software systems).

#### Theory of programming 
Theory of programming  including
= theoretical (algebraic, algorithmic, VDM, RAISE, etc.) and applied (object, component, aspect, etc.) methods intended for designing different types of target objects;
= methods of program verification with the help of formal (assertion, inference, and proof) procedures;
= methods of estimation of the results of sequential design (intermediate work products) from the processes of a project and estimation of quality indices (such as reliability, accuracy, throughput, etc.) of end-products;
= methods of management of work plans and checking of intermediate results over the processes of a project and also additional computational methods of 'estimation of working hours' for each work, its cost, etc

#### Languages, Means, and Tools of SE
As software products artefacts, all objects include descriptions of different kinds such as 
1. requirements on a development that are approved by the customer, 
2. an architecture, 
3. data structures, program specifications, etc.

Target objects are designed with the help of modern languages, including visual ones (for example, C++, Java, Pascal, UML, etc.), and the corresponding tool environments that contain required language converters and tools of supporting artefacts of development processes.

### Sw-Eng AS AN ENGINEERING DISCIPLINE
In SE, the engineering discipline (or engineering) includes 'methods' for supporting activities connected with manufacturing Software Product 
for 
'different kinds of target' objects using 
[methods, means, and tools] of the scientific discipline of SE [6-8].

#### Basic Elements 
The method founded on the following basic elements : 
(1) the SWEBOK
(2) basic_process_SE = core_of_process_activity_in_organizations_developing SPs;
(3) standards are represented by a collection of regulated rules of designing intermediate artefacts in LC processes;
(4) an infrastructure includes environmental conditions, methodical support of a basic process of SE, and executors engaged in manufacturing SPs;
(5) project management (www.pmi.com) includes standard regulations and processes and also scientific principles and methods of planning and project work management

### engineering viewpoint
From the engineering viewpoint, tasks of manufacturing SPs are performed in SE as technological processes of 
1. requirements formation, 
2. product design and support, 
3. and also 'check' of the operations of the basic process for the correctness of realization of different functional project tasks 
4. and execution of project works by the 'date fixed' by the customer.

SE can be considered from the following two viewpoints:
1. as an engineering activity in which engineers of different categories perform project works, taking into account corresponding theoretical methods and means of SE that are recommended in the SWEBOK and also regulations of processes of LC standards and methods selected for the processes;
2. as a project, quality, and risk management system together with rules and regulations of standards of LC, quality, and project management [7, 8].

### Sw-Eng IN PRACTICAL MEASUREMENTS
tentang apa sih?

The general destination of SE is practice, i.e., the construction of concrete computer programs, systems, and tools using theoretical and engineering methods.

The main distinctive feature of practice is the use of finished programs and Internet information resources (MatLab, Greenstone, Grid-systems, etc.). 

They can be accessed by any user, and he can get access to a finished resource as a service for nothing or buy it with money.

It can be used only once for solution of the corresponding problem or as some program of constant and repeated use in some domain. 

To date, the following three engineering approaches to the application of finished resources have been formed: reusing engineering, application engineering, and domain engineering.

They use reusable components (RUCs), applications, and systems in the capacity of finished resources. The use of finished resources, as well as a repeatedly reused finished product, effects a considerable saving in expenditures for constructing new software systems and families of systems from them. 

All kinds of RUCs remain in project storehouses or repositories [6, 7].

### Conclusion 
The paper present 
1. system analysis of SE in the scientific
2. system analysis of SE in the engineering
3. system analysis of SE in the practical-measurement
4. general interpretation of SE
5. argument and definition of object SE
6. argument and definition of SE
7. 

Contents of SE and destinations of SE are formulated. 

Engineering and practical aspects of construction of target software objects (software support, applications, and domains) from finished RUCs are proposed. 

A basic process of SE is demonstrated to be a process basis for the development of computer programs with the use of a body of knowledge, LC standards, the infrastructure, and management in a developer organization.

## jawaban RQ
1. Equation atau fenton menyebutnya Calculations yakni kombinasi dari attribute measurement.
Apakah sudah ada?
Sudah seperti cocomo, smell detection dgn kriteria tertentu.
Otak manusia dalam melihat kelas-function.
Jadi human involved.

### latar belakangnya
Saya ingin mengetahui korelasi antar kata yang sering terjadi. misal antar kata (engineering - project - time ) , saya coba mencarinya karena ingin semakin paham sebaran antara kata-kata mengenai engineering
