# defining the discipline
## IEEE definition
Software Engineering : 
software engineering adalah studi tentang penerapan
a. systematic (tertib), 
b. disciplined (ikuti aturan), 
c. quantifiable approach (bukannya mood-moodan wkwk)
terhadap
a. development, 
b. operation, and 
c. maintenance of software; 

atau sederhananya, 'the application of engineering to software'

## Layers
figure 2.1 show Software engineering layers

Software engineering is a layered technology. 
Merujuk Figure 2.1 , any engineering approach (including software engineering) must rest on an organizational commitment to quality. 

### Quality 
Total quality management, Six Sigma, and similar philosophies foster a continuous process improvement culture, and it is this culture that ultimately leads to the development of increasingly more effective approaches to software engineering. 
Bedrock dari software engineering is a 'quality focus'. 

### Process
The software engineering process is 
the glue that holds the 'technology layers' together 
and 
enables rational and timely development of computer software. 

Process defines a framework that must be established for effective delivery of software engineering technology. 

The software process 
1. forms the basis for 'management control' of software projects and 
2. establishes the context in which 
	a. technical methods are applied, 
	b. work products (models, documents, data, reports, forms, etc.) are produced, 
	c. milestones are established, 
	d. quality is ensured, and 
	e. change is properly managed. 	

example : 
1. AGILE(scrum, XP, etc)
2. Scientific-management(Waterfall,etc)

### Methods
Software engineering methods provide the 'technical how-to's' for building software. 
Methods encompass a broad 'array of tasks' that include 
1. communication, 
2. requirements analysis, 
3. design modeling, 
4. program construction, 
5. testing, and 
6. support. 

Software engineering methods rely on a 'set of basic principles' that govern each area of the technology and include modeling activities and other descriptive techniques. 

### Tools

### Process vs Methods
1. Objective 
process : management control on [money,time,scope], disiplin tentang method yang harus dilakukan
method : technical how-to do on tasks[1..5]
