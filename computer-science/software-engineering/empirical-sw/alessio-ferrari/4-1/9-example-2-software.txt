9. second example : software and human
(40:40 - 48:24)
======================================

this is another example with software and humans , okay? 


and in this case like it is an example that we considered also before 

I want to see if the experience of the user affects the "effectiveness" of a certain tool , okay? 

the dependent variable in this case is there is the one that we took from last experiment 
so it's the 'efectiveness' " that is 
the number of bugs found(NBF)
divided by 
the total number of bugs (TNB) 
in a certain piece of code 
-----------------
efectiveness = NBF/TNB

so this is the dependent variable that I want to that I want to observe while they're independent variable is is the experience of the of the user but the issue here is how can I measure this experience while before the independent variable was tool a or told B it was it was quite clear straightforward we didn't even think about measuring the independent variable because it was a binary variable basically 
so either you use tool a or to B but in this case your independent variable is the experience and this is how to measure it I can consider how can I measure the experience of a user where I can consider the years of experience is stay in testing or I can ask what the years of experience may tell you something but they don't tell you how much how expert is really that person 
so you may want to ask the colleagues to judge a certain person and to score this person for for expertise in testing , okay? um 


so in general it is better to select one independent measure for the variable , okay? 
so otherwise have many too many treatments and might not find enough participants , okay? 
so better to select one of this measure and justify but , okay? 


so let's consider since it is easier to evaluate although not necessarily perfect I consider the years but sure that you consider 
one year 
two years 
four years 
five years 
so by single year or  can I group this year?

well if I decide that I choose one two three four as differences 

so I want to see how a different of one year only can affect the usage of a certain tool well this may be difficult in several terms because maybe the difference between two and three years of experience is not that much 


and in addition I need to find enough people for the experiment 

so I have to find many people 
who have just one year 
many people who have just two years 
many people who have three years and 

so it may be very complicated again as an experiment 
so probably is better to separate to select some levels , okay? 

how to select the level ? 

I have to do some assumptions , okay? 
I have to take some assumption take from the literature or justify and defend my decision , okay? 

there is no no silver bullet in here , okay? 
and often you research on other studies that have done choice that is similar to yours or you you have to consider also common sense and your knowledge, for example : I can decide for two levels , okay? 

and in this level I have two treatments one from zero to one years novices and more than five years experts , okay? 


so in this case I have eliminated people that are in the in-between ok 

there is a radical difference (of course) between zero - one year and more than five years , okay? 

so this is evident and it is common sense that I don't need to justify much , okay? 
so think about that  !

(of course) if you have people that have between two and four years of experience 
and these are a candidate for your experiment 
you cannot choose them 
you cannot see really 
you cannot involve them , okay? 


now it will identify the control variables again the question is the usual one what can impact on my outcomes besides the experience here I don't have the code I don't have the objects but I have people 
so in this case I can have age gender demographic variable 
so how old am where do they come from where did they study , okay? from which company are they coming from and (of course) again the code on which the tool is is applied , okay? 
so the other previous variable 
so you see that this experiment becomes much more complicated I have to make some choice I fix some some code base we use the same for a subject and make sure also in this case in say up also interacting aspects make sure none of them have shown I've seen the code in advance because if for example if I have to test certain code that I have already tested I know already which are the bugs 
so it's this is a this is affecting my experiment 
so and but all but since in some cases 

it may be the case that 
if you 
if you're using code from a certain company 
and the people are from the same company it is possible that P those people have seen that code , okay? and these joopa dyes your experiments , okay? and and then I control demographic variables , okay? select the rebels in a way that I have a representative group of people without imbalance in terms of age for example otherwise if I cannot do that again I restrict my scope of interest if I find just people for example you know that are all coming from the same company (of course) the result of my experiment is limited to the characteristic of the specific company and may be extended to companies with similar characteristics and with similar trainings for example ok 
so at the end this is my design and I have a group with a comparable experience novice or expert but variations in terms of age gender and other demographic aspects and I have a code base 


so I have designed my experience you see that here when I said this requires a lot of creativity it requires a lot of creativity you have to think truly about what are your constructs how to measure them how to create your variables how to how to measure the variables and you have to consider different factors that are also related to the possibilities that you have because when you build a software experiment a software engineering experiment you you don't have infinite resources if you had used it 

for example if we are involved in developers and as we said in the last lecture this developer they have to do their work their daily work 
so they cannot stay in your experiment for two hours and there are also fatigue and other factors that may affect the experiment 
so is the is really again optimizing between different factors , okay?
