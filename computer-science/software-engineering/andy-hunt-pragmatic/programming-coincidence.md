# A Debugging Mindset
The easiest person to deceive is one's self

sebelum start debugging, lakukan turn off  terhadap
1. defense utk protect egomu
2. pressure utk deliver secepatnya

sehingga kita jadi comfort utk coding.

Tip 25
Don't Panic

## where to start
Make sure, code compile without warning.
Set warning pada compiler as high as possible.

We routinely set compiler warning levels as high as possible. 

It doesn't make sense to waste time
trying to find a problem that the compiler could find for you! We need to
concentrate on the harder problems at hand.
When trying to solve any problem, you need to gather all the relevant data.
Unfortunately, bug reporting isn't an exact science. It's easy to be misled by
coincidences, and you can't afford to waste time debugging coincidences.
You first need to be accurate in your observations.

# Programming by Coincidence

Do you ever watch old black-and-white war movies? 

The weary soldier advances cautiously out of the brush. There's a clearing ahead: are there any land mines, or is it safe to cross? There aren't any indications that it's a minefieldâ€”no signs, barbed wire, or craters. The soldier pokes the ground ahead of him with his bayonet and winces, expecting an explosion. 

There isn't one. So he proceeds painstakingly through the field for a while, prodding and poking as he goes. 


Eventually, convinced that the field is safe, he straightens up and marches proudly forward, only to be blown to pieces.
