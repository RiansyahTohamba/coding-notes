1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,080
okay in the previous slides I showed you

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,559
the an overview basically of what what

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,450
you are going to learn through this

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,179
course and mainly not really an overview

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,460
because you didn't see so much about the

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,410
methodologies but more of the motivation

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,550
why the thing that I would present you

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,960
in this course are irrelevant I

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,850
mentioned during the presentation that

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,020
we will have to deal with with several

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,260
stakeholders and I mention different

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,550
activities in the software engineering

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,010
process that are development testing etc

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,360
now let's see which which ones are the

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,550
roles that you would deal with in this

16
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,250
that you will deal with with the

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,989
different methods and the tasks in the

18
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,059
software engineering process this is

19
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,080
just a very very very broad overview

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,110
okay we chart the roles roll it software

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,799
engineering are different they change

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,090
based on the process also that you may

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,130
have in a company they vary on the

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,890
dimension of the company I will not I

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,470
will always repeat it until you are

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,900
tired that every company is different

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,060
every context is different but in

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,390
general a software engineering company

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,939
or a software company always have at

30
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,000
least the developers that are the ones

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,060
who do the coding of course this could

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,729
be also in principle outsourced because

33
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,360
I may be a company that have some that

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,210
doesn't develop in-house but is just

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,820
combining the code developed by

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,950
different developers outside but in

37
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,860
general in some way developers as always

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,670
him are always involved sometimes so you

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,600
may have designers and architects so

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,520
designers an architect I'm reading in

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
the slide from the bottom and like

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,940
checking some roads somewhat randomly

43
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,650
designers and architects are the wise

44
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,299
design the system at a high level and

45
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,870
the ones who do the project basically

46
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,420
very often is more company these are the

47
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,000
same as developers so-and-so or they

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,959
don't even exist if you are if you are

49
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,440
in a company where you are you don't

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,000
design the software but you simply

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,040
incrementally develop it so you don't

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,030
have this this type of roles okay you

53
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,190
add the requirements or business analyst

54
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,959
we would see the requirements engineer

55
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,239
business and several names are used for

56
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,280
that functional analysts in some cases

57
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,739
and this is the ones that gather the

58
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,359
requirements from customers and users

59
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:58,170
and create their requirements documents

60
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,930
to be used by the developers but very

61
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,769
often this is just a guy that interact

62
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,650
with the customer and doesn't write down

63
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,510
the requirements document but simply

64
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,609
speak with the developers to say what

65
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,650
they should do or write down the

66
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,569
so-called user stores that are short

67
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,790
form of requirements if you are using

68
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,139
so-called

69
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,470
agile processes okay then you have the

70
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,470
users the one that will use the system

71
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,690
and the customers the by the ones who

72
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,970
buy the system these are also in the

73
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,129
scope of our interest what is the

74
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,349
difference between customers clients

75
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,819
that say and uses normal users are the

76
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,319
actual users for example in the example

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,480
that I made in the previous part of the

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,099
lecture in which I was considered and

79
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,849
hoskin see during a hospital the user of

80
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,379
the system to update information about

81
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,250
the coronavirus are actually the doctors

82
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,829
so the general practice doctors the

83
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,379
so-called Medici de Familia in Italian

84
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,720
these are the users of the system but

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,849
they don't they don't pay for the system

86
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,069
and they don't pay for the development

87
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,280
of the system the customer is actually

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,590
the

89
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,260
they have the Health Organization they

90
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,750
held company for example the hospital or

91
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,680
if you are dealing with the if you want

92
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,990
to deliver this product to the wall

93
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,720
settle Ospital in tuscany for example it

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,300
will be the region so you have different

95
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,860
subjects that have different needs

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,470
because the user probably in this case

97
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,260
don't care about the the price of the

98
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,080
software while the customer does and in

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
some cases the users are also customers

100
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,260
for example in case there of mobile

101
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,010
application of any consumer softwares

102
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,600
for example if you think netflix

103
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,930
software we're all users but we pay for

104
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,080
it

105
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,260
and we're also customers so but have you

106
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,710
ever have you ever met someone from from

107
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,800
netflix asking you what is what is your

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,050
need for good bit in the system it

109
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,950
didn't happen

110
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,610
so you ever roll but you don't interact

111
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,130
directly with them but they can

112
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,090
understand what you did by sampling from

113
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,090
from your interaction with the system

114
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,010
they try to understand when you are

115
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,970
watching those movies which type of

116
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,650
movies are you watching and they

117
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,340
understand what are your needs based on

118
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,860
the usage of the system and this is

119
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,320
typical of for many consumer products

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,400
like for example Netflix or any app that

121
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,440
you have in your mobile or Microsoft

122
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,190
Word or any of this type of code summer

123
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,880
pro consumers products that that I used

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,789
by mmm that are used by by people that

125
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,550
are oriented to the large market and are

126
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,120
not specific for solving a problem like

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
the one I said for the hospital or for a

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
chain of supermarkets for itself if the

129
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,930
company is large you may have also some

130
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,510
managers in general you distinguish

131
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,870
between three levels of management in a

132
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,760
large company you have top-level

133
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,830
managers which are responsible for

134
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,570
controlling oversees the entire

135
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,180
organization so this is a top level

136
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,370
meet the level which are responsible for

137
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,180
executing organization plans according

138
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,030
to the company policies and they are

139
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,490
basically intermediate towards the top

140
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,220
management and low-level manager that

141
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,980
are ever direct contact with the

142
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,640
developers they say and often they are

143
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,530
called

144
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,900
project manager okay they ever there are

145
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,210
role models for the employees they

146
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,130
supervise and they control the timing

147
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,970
and they do more fine-tuned to control

148
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,180
but they don't give let's say the the

149
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,090
decision for the decision for a more

150
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,890
larger plan they are focused on a

151
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,650
project or two projects and they direct

152
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,100
the specific projects but there are more

153
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,200
level of management of all above them

154
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,970
and then there is the Board of Directors

155
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,960
so it's a people group elected by the

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,480
stockholders possible if if it is a

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,790
company if it is a market company and

158
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,010
they decide corporate policies and make

159
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,290
management decisions normally when we

160
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,790
study when we study software engineering

161
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,000
problems we don't do much with the Board

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,340
of Directors of course we may deal with

163
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,040
managers because the low-level managers

164
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,210
especially the project managers are are

165
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,280
dealing with the software and they are

166
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,220
really relevant roles we deal with

167
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,380
customers we use it with requirements

168
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,330
business scientists sometimes will

169
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,490
report designers and architects although

170
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,580
many companies don't have them and we

171
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,740
developers and testers so testers are

172
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,450
the ones who test the code so the

173
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,770
subjects that may be also or subjects

174
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,110
who review the code this is the review

175
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,940
the code they simply don't test but just

176
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,700
look at the code and check for the

177
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,030
quality this may be often the developer

178
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,870
themselves so everything may be adapted

179
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,530
to a specific company's need but these

180
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,000
are the main Rosemere names that you

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,950
will

182
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,110
that you will hear and you will read

183
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,960
about in software engineering

184
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,950
publications as I said companies may

185
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,340
include the only a subset of the roles

186
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,810
some of the roles may be covered by the

187
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,770
same person

188
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,340
so as I said some testers may be

189
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,220
actually developers some code reviewers

190
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,260
may be actually developers or the

191
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,630
designers may be the developers and in

192
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,700
some cases even the business analyst may

193
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,390
be the developers and the role may

194
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,670
depend of the adopter software process

195
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,330
so there I didn't go through this

196
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,380
disaster but there are two let's say

197
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,290
general general paradigm of software

198
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,600
process one is the traditional software

199
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,020
process that is the so-called waterful

200
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,380
process and in which you have the

201
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,300
sequence of steps like the one that I

202
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,010
described so you start from the

203
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,020
requirements you start with the

204
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,700
interaction with the customer you write

205
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,610
the requirements you design the software

206
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,910
you write down the code you test it in

207
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:53,300
etc etc or you have the so called guides

208
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,290
of the process and that is the more

209
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,060
modern way of programming of developing

210
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,650
software that consists in having

211
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:11,120
frequent interactions and frequent the

212
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,570
delivery of prototypes and rapid

213
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,980
implementation so the you don't wait to

214
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,070
develop you don't wait for the entire

215
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,110
requirements document to be completed or

216
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,780
the design to be completed before coding

217
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,670
but you start prototyping Cinda bit

218
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,680
since the beginning and you have

219
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,810
frequent stand-up meeting with the other

220
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,770
partners and you have more relevance of

221
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,830
interaction between between people so

222
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,660
rows may depend on the way that you

223
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,720
decide to develop your software which

224
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,240
are the main tasks the main tasks you

225
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,030
saw them in the in the previous in the

226
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,990
previous

227
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,180
in Denisha slides but I want to

228
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,170
emphasize them in here because the

229
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,660
examples that I will give throughout the

230
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,970
world the world class that will deal

231
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,100
with this aspect so when I speak about

232
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,830
requirements elicitation and analysis I

233
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,590
speak about the first phase in which you

234
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,490
try to understand what is needed to be

235
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:16,940
built

236
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,640
okay so requirements elicitation and

237
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,020
analysis is a very vast area and may

238
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,790
have different practical practical

239
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,200
solution in the sense that as I told

240
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,200
before you may have situation in which

241
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,240
you interact directly with the customer

242
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,340
so with the people who will pay you for

243
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,540
your product or you may build a consumer

244
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,900
product and so you have to harvest

245
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,960
gather the requirements from from the

246
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,350
mass from the people or just rely on new

247
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,550
ideas internal and then test these ideas

248
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,080
that are internal to your compendious

249
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,320
test this idea with the people of course

250
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
they didn't ask people for the iPod or

251
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,860
they didn't ask people for when they

252
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,980
invented the car so many new invention

253
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,890
also in software they come from ideas

254
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,320
and observation of reality and don't

255
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,350
need to require a direct interaction at

256
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,720
least at the beginning with the user but

257
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,000
it has been demonstrated that the

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,190
involvement of the users since the

259
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,190
beginning may be really useful to test

260
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,380
your idea I understand that you're not

261
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,630
wasting your money in the in the

262
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,670
investment that you are doing software

263
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,160
architecture software so this

264
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,380
requirement solicitation and analysis

265
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,870
analysis means means several things

266
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,390
means try to structure the requirements

267
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,240
imagine for example the requirements for

268
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,050
a system that is built on the trains

269
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,150
that you are using you may be using not

270
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,160
now how much usually the system that

271
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,640
brakes the train in case the driver

272
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,820
exceeds with the control speed

273
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,100
the requirements for these are like 300

274
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,110
or 400 pages long and this is just one

275
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,840
part or the more technical required and

276
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,400
you have different volumes that specify

277
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,730
how this software the different parts

278
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,750
related to the risk to them today other

279
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,650
aspect let's say of the process but it's

280
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,700
like a very large volume and analyzing

281
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,250
these requirements means that first

282
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,330
you've gone through the process of

283
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,040
starting from more abstract requirements

284
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,140
let's say then you have formalize them

285
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,270
and then you have checked that there is

286
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,490
no ambiguity in these documents that

287
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,740
they have being that they are clearly

288
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,190
understood by anyone who reads them etc

289
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,400
okay so the analysis process success

290
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,220
especially for very complex systems is a

291
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,810
very safety critical system like the

292
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,330
trains or aircraft is very it's very

293
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,600
long this this phase in which you try to

294
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,060
understand them formalize in written

295
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,190
form your requirements then you have the

296
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,360
software architecture software

297
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,330
architecture was what I what I was

298
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,700
speaking was so before about that is

299
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,360
design and softer so creating the the

300
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,220
picture of your soft train you I met

301
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,090
before you implement it UML is the most

302
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,090
common way of designing your software

303
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,310
software architecture of course that

304
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,320
there is a distinction between software

305
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,120
architecture and design because

306
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,240
architecture is more high level while

307
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,400
design is more related to object

308
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,650
oriented design let's say so it's more

309
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,020
detail why the architecture should be

310
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,690
language independent normal so doesn't

311
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,970
rely on objects and this type of stuff

312
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,920
but for what we are interested here

313
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,230
software architecture is building

314
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,410
somehow a model of what will be the

315
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,060
structure of the software that satisfies

316
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,550
the requirements that I am licit it so

317
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,680
if the development is the actual act or

318
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,809
developing that is not simply opening

319
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,029
the computer and start writing the code

320
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,819
is also interacting with the other

321
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,949
developers interacting with the software

322
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:32,420
architects interactive with the

323
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,779
requirements elicitation fair with the

324
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,240
requirements analyst so interacting with

325
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,029
several other subject and writing down

326
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:43,459
what the software should do but also the

327
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,769
bug in the sauce because of course when

328
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,990
you write the software you into it it

329
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,449
doesn't it doesn't always work properly

330
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,410
but also refactor the software so I mean

331
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,279
it - I find a bug that effects a certain

332
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,439
part of the software I need to refactor

333
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,959
it or I need to refactor the software

334
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,850
because new requirements come from the

335
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,920
customer can have several cases of

336
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,100
course then you have software testing

337
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,499
software testing also in this case you

338
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,809
may have different levels of testing for

339
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,360
example you have only a function level

340
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,480
you have only to do unit testing for a

341
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,420
Java program so you test just that unit

342
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,679
according to a set of tests or you may

343
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,509
need to do integration testing

344
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,790
integration testing means that for

345
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,860
example for the system that I was

346
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,259
exemplified before for stopping the

347
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,009
training case there is a the driver

348
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:44,629
exceeds the the maximum speed in that

349
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,529
case I may need first of all one system

350
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,679
that is on board but the system has to

351
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,540
be linked also to the brake so I need to

352
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,509
integrate probably the software that is

353
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,790
directly controlling the brake with the

354
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,409
software that is in this other box and

355
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:09,439
antis is monitoring the speed of the

356
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,419
train and in addition in this

357
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,109
architecture am I also have some

358
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,209
software that is deployed deployed on

359
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:20,179
the ground that is sending for example

360
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,010
the status of the Signet so the

361
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,398
semaphores that you that you meet across

362
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:28,640
the line so i have to integrate it to

363
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,130
check that all these elements interact

364
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,529
properly and this is so-called

365
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,250
integration testing

366
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,420
not this real same thing of the of the

367
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,090
unit testing which I test a function but

368
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,090
still I'm doing an a testing activity

369
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,860
and this is of interest for for for

370
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,780
software engineering and for our scope

371
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,300
then there is software documentation is

372
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,970
something that is normally poorly done

373
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,870
but in some cases is mandatory so it is

374
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,850
for example when you are developing

375
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,520
safety critical systems you have to

376
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,700
document each step of your of your

377
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,010
process and you have to careful the

378
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,930
human chess software super so writing

379
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,120
down the the what the software is doing

380
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,210
and if you if you are if you are

381
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,320
developing also man wants for example

382
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,670
for users or man was for developers also

383
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,250
how the software should be used and how

384
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,950
it should be extent and maintained and

385
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,450
then you have software maintenance

386
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,700
software maintenance is the other phase

387
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,680
in which okay I need to update the

388
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,540
software based on new requirements

389
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,550
normally the software developers are

390
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,620
involved in here but the activity is

391
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,540
completely different because I have to

392
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,420
refactor normally software do small

393
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,920
changes debug etc and finally there is

394
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,290
the software process management as a

395
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,450
short in the beginning of the

396
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,120
presentation there is a process this

397
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,180
process need to be managed by somehow by

398
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,850
some but as some people I've shown three

399
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,390
level of Management and these three

400
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,780
levels are involved in checking that the

401
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,050
word process runs smoothly but software

402
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,000
process management is also dealing with

403
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,920
concurrent versioning systems dealing

404
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,330
with bugs bug report dealing with all

405
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,590
the older tools and echo and and system

406
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,050
that allows me to better manage my

407
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,350
softer so summarize in software

408
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,960
engineering we are dealing with all the

409
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,150
roads that I listed in this previous

410
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,179
slide

411
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,139
in with all these roles from managers to

412
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:55,149
customers to uses to requirements

413
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:57,249
analyze to designers to developers and

414
00:19:57,249 --> 00:19:57,879
testers

415
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,369
and more you I will show you more

416
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,889
details on the role when we will speak

417
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:05,950
about surveys which are more focused on

418
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,969
people so you need to understand more in

419
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:15,999
detail what are the roles and these are

420
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,009
the tasks so these people and these

421
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,099
tasks so we will deal with station

422
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,509
architecture development testing

423
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,219
documentation maintenance a software

424
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,649
process management you don't need to

425
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:30,759
learn in depth what are all these phases

426
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,179
what I told you now should be sufficient

427
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,320
to have a sufficient understanding

428
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,450
because here we are focused on tasks and

429
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,759
people but mostly on methodological

430
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,099
aspects so let's pass to this other part

431
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:52,119
and this will be the last the last part

432
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,739
for for today that is related to one of

433
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:00,269
the core one of the core element of

434
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:03,339
research that is the formulating

435
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:08,139
research questions so basically anything

436
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:11,979
that that you do in research in software

437
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,779
engineering but also in any type of

438
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,450
research starts with a question about

439
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,809
the reality ok a question about the

440
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,210
world this is normal in software

441
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,889
engineering a problem to solve

442
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:26,320
so the question about the word is how

443
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,899
can I solve this problem but it can be

444
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:31,479
also curiosity about some of surveyed

445
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:35,409
fact this curiosity is often related to

446
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:37,690
something that you that you feel is

447
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,239
relevant but you you cannot say why for

448
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:44,529
you is relevant and for example it is

449
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:46,509
interesting to know why do developers

450
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,909
prefer to work at night isn't it it's

451
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,639
something interesting but why is it

452
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:54,849
interesting why you are asking this

453
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:56,679
question you really don't know but

454
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,700
probably if if you understand why for

455
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,950
example by interviewing set of the

456
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,679
you may understand that these will help

457
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,109
you in in better in better plan your

458
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:16,059
software process in better define for

459
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:18,159
example your schedule for for your

460
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,899
company because if you find that

461
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:21,789
developers prefer to work at night so

462
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,460
why should you force them to work during

463
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,419
the day why should you have a strict

464
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,190
strict timing or if you discover that

465
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,840
this is not true and some people prefer

466
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,700
to work at night some people prefer to

467
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,450
work during the day

468
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,149
why don't you profit from that for that

469
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,970
from that and you start having some

470
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,220
people working during the day and some

471
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,899
people working during the night so you

472
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:50,799
have 24 hours people working and it can

473
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,869
be also some curiosity about some

474
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:55,690
unknown fact so some unknown fact this

475
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,730
is the curiosity about something that

476
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,499
you may have observed so you have an

477
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:01,239
intuition and you are curious to know

478
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:03,580
but also you want to know something that

479
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,859
you don't know sufficient you want to

480
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,019
explore so for example what are the most

481
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,149
frequent effects in open source code

482
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:12,820
which are their most typical the the

483
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,129
fact that you can find in open source

484
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,109
code this can be a vague curiosity you

485
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,850
don't know why it's interesting but you

486
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,690
may be interested in that the research

487
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,289
question is the inquiry that guides your

488
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,259
research so it's a question written in

489
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:30,730
natural language when I say natural

490
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,340
language I say means English Italian any

491
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,649
language that you normally use a spoken

492
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:39,369
language or written form in this case

493
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:43,029
and the research question can be

494
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,889
something like which are the most

495
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:46,929
frequent effects in code developed by

496
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,669
people with less than six months of

497
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:50,889
experience so by novices this is a

498
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:54,639
research question also which are the

499
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,049
most frequent effects in the code

500
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:58,029
developed by people from six months to

501
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:00,220
three years experience so this is

502
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,749
another research question a search

503
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:03,850
question is something that it's written

504
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,480
is clear and guides your research and

505
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,629
you should always refer to it to design

506
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:13,380
your research

507
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,270
you know my structure your research and

508
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,880
reporting according to one or more

509
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,270
research question writing them down can

510
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,690
help you to clarify your goal and also

511
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,310
not just to you but also to the reader

512
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,890
because you do research but you have to

513
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,090
communicate it of course because anytime

514
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,550
anytime you you research research for

515
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,550
something if you don't communicate it is

516
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,830
useless okay it's just useful probably

517
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,010
for you for your knowledge but it's not

518
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,440
useful for the other researchers or the

519
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,580
other software engineers normally if you

520
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,170
have more than one research questions

521
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,090
it is good to establish their general

522
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,130
research question or research objective

523
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,860
so for example if I want to consider how

524
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,770
aspects so how things are in practice so

525
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,970
more curiosity about observable fact I

526
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,220
can ask myself to eat just answers and

527
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,990
effect types are related to the degree

528
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,060
of experience of the developer this is a

529
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,150
general research question and the other

530
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,920
two question that you saw at the

531
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,930
beginning on slide so which are the most

532
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,350
frequent defects in code

533
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,730
developed by people with less than six

534
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,500
months experience and the other question

535
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,130
about the facts they encode developed by

536
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,410
people that are older this can be

537
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,720
summarized with a more general research

538
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,640
question is quite intuitive like to

539
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,380
adjust and certain defects type are

540
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,600
related to the degree of experience of

541
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,370
the developer I want to understand the

542
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,110
relation between degree of experience

543
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:52,320
and defect I because my idea is that no

544
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,080
of these people tend to introduce more

545
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,720
of a certain kind of defect while older

546
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,180
people tend to do mistake that are more

547
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,350
or less a at architectural level but I

548
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,560
can also introduce a more general

549
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,020
question also related to this like that

550
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,720
consider also why aspects for example

551
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,270
which is the relationship between the

552
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,360
defects types and degree of experience

553
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,150
of the developer so this is more vague

554
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,880
okay is not just that I'm searching

555
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,100
for relationship between the fax type

556
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,770
and degree of experience I'm also and

557
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,660
trying to understand what type of our

558
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,150
relationship is there in a broad sense

559
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,380
so why for example people that have less

560
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,810
experience do certain type of defects

561
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,990
and in this case probably I need to go

562
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,620
further and not just do an experiment

563
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,840
for example in which I have young people

564
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,190
odd people and let them program and see

565
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,200
the defects that they make and in order

566
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,290
to interview them and to ask them why

567
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,490
they committed a certain defect and to

568
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,670
check with them for some motivation that

569
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,330
can make me better understand the

570
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,580
relationship between the effect type and

571
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,890
degree of experience of the developer

572
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:25,080
okay this is a something quite difficult

573
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,280
to grasp but I invite you to to reason

574
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,590
about that because the difference

575
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,240
between and between how things works and

576
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,750
why things works in a certain way is

577
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,660
very relevant and you need always always

578
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,470
you need to resort to a different type

579
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,320
of methods if you want to understand

580
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,020
both how aspects so how things are

581
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,180
related with the sort of correlation

582
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,600
that's a correlation function and why

583
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,540
aspects so find the human reason behind

584
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,950
certain phenomena so many times a clear

585
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,450
formulation of the general research

586
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,240
question comes after the formulation of

587
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,070
the most specific research question so

588
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,310
it is easier to write down which are the

589
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,020
most frequent effects in code developed

590
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,840
by people that has less than six months

591
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,460
experience because it's more practical

592
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,560
you know you know that you have to

593
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,690
select people will assign some months

594
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,030
experience but then you have to think

595
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,190
what is the thing that I want to

596
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,010
understand I want to understand

597
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,890
relationship between age and type of

598
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,470
defects and I

599
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,680
to understand also why there is if there

600
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,060
is a relationship this relationship

601
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,100
holds in some cases to distinguish you

602
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,590
can between like detailed research

603
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,240
question like the ones that I listed

604
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,700
before and the more general research

605
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,280
question you can sometimes formulate the

606
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,170
general research question as a research

607
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,270
objective so instead of a question just

608
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,600
a sentence like the objective is

609
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,040
understanding to each stand a certain

610
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,950
defect types are related to the degree

611
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,350
of experience of a developer so this is

612
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,750
what is my research objective how do I

613
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:23,130
pack it into partition it into different

614
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,900
questions yes I start with the first

615
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,940
questions which are the most frequent

616
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,010
effects for people with six months

617
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,930
experience the most recurring the first

618
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,300
with people with between six and three

619
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,940
six months and three years and then I

620
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,010
can add the other other question for

621
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,960
people who have who have more who have

622
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,210
more experience and finally answering

623
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,460
the general question that will tell me

624
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,630
which are which is actually the

625
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,750
relationship between the the type of

626
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,200
defects and the years of experience here

627
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,600
I will I will tell you how to to write

628
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,120
down I will give you a guide that is

629
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,190
taken from Robert felt you can check

630
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,390
this PDF inning in Internet that is is

631
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,990
free that is very simplified guide to

632
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,260
how to formulate research questions it

633
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,750
is very important it is not important

634
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:28,200
really to let's say to to remember this

635
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,350
graph this structure but it's important

636
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,320
to refer to possible example actually of

637
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,870
research questions but of course

638
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,160
didactic li-like for for teaching you

639
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,300
for teaching you the different types of

640
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,010
research question is very useful to have

641
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,220
this classification okay so we have a

642
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,860
first of all research question in

643
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,990
software engineer you have to type as I

644
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,610
told you at the beginning for

645
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,400
we need to understand the reality and

646
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,640
then we build a solution so my research

647
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,440
question can be knowledge for Houston so

648
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,260
understanding the reality or solution

649
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,600
focus so the objective is transforming

650
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,330
the reality okay let's start with the

651
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,340
knowledge focused noise focus can be

652
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,670
exploratory so I don't know much about

653
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,430
the phenomenon and the studies I want to

654
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,950
create some tentative series I want to

655
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,500
try out some hypothesis and I want to

656
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,540
give evidence for example that a certain

657
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,090
phenomenon that I want to study can be

658
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,330
made measured for example the consumes

659
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,330
question should be general is

660
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,180
exploratory it's a new thing that I

661
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,330
don't know anything about for example to

662
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,820
which extent do developers get tired of

663
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,400
coding I still don't know if they get

664
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,300
tired of coding okay and I still don't

665
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,120
know why they make a tile coding so this

666
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,540
to which extent is a simple way of

667
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,020
saying hey explore this theme explore

668
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,190
this topic okay then I have a base rate

669
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,040
question base rate question and when you

670
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,950
already know something about certain

671
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,180
phenomenon we want to understand out the

672
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,920
phenomenon and the study appears which

673
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,730
are the normal patterns and this can be

674
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,860
asked when you already know a little bit

675
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,860
so you know that people are able the

676
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,000
people tend to get tired of coding my

677
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,980
more detailed question is about

678
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,770
frequency when the developer gets out oh

679
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:43,820
god okay so I ask I ask myself something

680
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,020
about related to the base rate that can

681
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,060
be frequency or can be process we'd see

682
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,950
more more example later on other so this

683
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,470
in the first case in exploratory case I

684
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,600
don't know anything now I know that the

685
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,730
certain phenomena happen and can be

686
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,650
measured so I asking a base rate

687
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,850
question in a different stage

688
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,440
the research and then I can also ask a

689
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,470
more detailed question like for example

690
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,860
how certain phenomenon under study

691
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,980
relates to other phenomena so why do

692
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,500
developers get tired of coding I asked

693
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,679
myself so which are the cows causes as

694
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:29,309
you see there is already causality there

695
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:34,000
which are the causes of for people to

696
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,820
get tired of coding ok these are

697
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,120
different levels that for knowledge

698
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,940
focus question that I normally reached

699
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,019
when you have different degrees of

700
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:51,159
knowledge of a system theme then you

701
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,330
have solution focus questions and

702
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,610
basically they describe better ways to

703
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,320
solve a problem or a certain situation

704
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,559
so which strategies app to achieve a

705
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,039
certain certain goal how can we refine a

706
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,520
certain tool to achieve certain goal in

707
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,879
a better way so they are related with

708
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,339
creating the new solution or refining an

709
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:17,379
existing solution these are still

710
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:18,940
research question as I told you before

711
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,230
because I need to find a way I need to

712
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,418
create an importance for a solution and

713
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:28,149
I have to test the hypothesis against

714
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,399
the reality like in the example before I

715
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,199
have to check that my proposal of

716
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,750
forbidding the people to work at night

717
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,540
actually reduces the number of bug in my

718
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,949
code and doesn't create new new problems

719
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,960
ok so here you have the different

720
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,069
subtypes I leave you I leave you this

721
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:58,390
this from from the from the work of

722
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,230
Robert felt that that is linked in this

723
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,660
light and I related to exploratory

724
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,940
questions can be of three types like

725
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,349
system descriptive and comparative so

726
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,960
existence is thus this phenomenon exists

727
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,360
so as I told before

728
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,440
that do people get tired of coding or

729
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,060
not is this thing that software

730
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,620
engineers really do like for example is

731
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,030
documentation something that they really

732
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,000
do because in a survey I may have in an

733
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,030
interview I may have understood that

734
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,920
these people are really really annoyed

735
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,210
by the fact of writing down

736
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,250
documentation and they say that is one

737
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,380
of the most time consuming activity of

738
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:57,070
the world but do they really document

739
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,130
the software and this is often not the

740
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,880
case so asking this this type of

741
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,300
existence question is important also for

742
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,080
understanding which one is the is the

743
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,240
reality okay for certain phenomena

744
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,020
actually existed deserves to be studied

745
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,530
descriptive descriptive cases are more

746
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,570
related to properties and attribution

747
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,820
thing that I can measure of a certain

748
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,100
phenomenon like what are the properties

749
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,340
attributes of a certain phenomenon for

750
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:42,910
example when it is is it is it is it

751
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,820
free not frequent but for example how

752
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,740
long is the documentation that they

753
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,120
produce for example and in any case the

754
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,520
things that are related to not to the

755
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,470
existent busted a discrete general

756
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,390
high-level description of a certain

757
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,060
phenomenon and comparative like how can

758
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,370
a certain phenomenon differ from another

759
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,550
phenomenon then you have the base rate

760
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:09,370
as I told there are can be related to

761
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,370
frequency of or to the process so how

762
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,850
often or how does this phenomenon

763
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:21,250
normally normally occur then you have

764
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,770
the relationship that are again very

765
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,120
similar to the exploratory they are

766
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,440
similar to inspiratory but instead of

767
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,260
focusing on a single element they relate

768
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,000
to

769
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,280
multiple elements for example do

770
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,770
occurrence is the of X correlate with a

771
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,820
certain other phenomenon or what are the

772
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,670
reason for a certain phenomenon do I

773
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,290
know that a certain phenomenon cause

774
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,170
causes another cause or prevent another

775
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:55,490
phenomenon and more related to actual

776
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:00,270
causes so causality related question can

777
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:04,230
be comparative of context related until

778
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,900
you have a couple a couple of examples

779
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,080
so these are just a list of typical

780
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,420
example of question can guide you in

781
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,490
better formulating the research question

782
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:16,710
this is quite important for you because

783
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,190
it would be part also of the exam to be

784
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,250
able to formulate research questions

785
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,580
okay so please pay attention to these

786
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,160
consider this material try to formulate

787
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,100
research questions and try to give your

788
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,030
own example and understand what is they

789
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,030
their classification as I said the

790
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,090
classification is useful to to give you

791
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,630
a way of of making sense of the

792
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,220
different types of question but in the

793
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,420
end it is useful to look at examples ok

794
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,020
this list of examples if you replace the

795
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,420
X and the y with some phenomena of

796
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,000
interest for software engineers they

797
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,970
they can be really useful for you how to

798
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,030
create research question you create

799
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,240
research questions by starting from not

800
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,200
a well-defined research objective

801
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,570
because as I said before it usually come

802
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,990
afterwards with the topic normally so it

803
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,080
can be software development speed and

804
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,210
then you can ask yourself do you want to

805
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,400
create more a better understanding or

806
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,280
you want to solve something related to

807
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,100
development speed if you want to create

808
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,600
better understanding then you are

809
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,960
dealing with a knowledge-based question

810
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,460
and you want to ask yourself something

811
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,560
like what effects development speed how

812
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,410
can we measure development speed so how

813
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,960
can we measure how fast are the people

814
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,650
in developing

815
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,840
what if then I have to ask myself okay

816
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,250
I've understood that I have a

817
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,320
knowledge-based question I have to

818
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,660
understand how much is known about this

819
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,080
specific topic if not much is known I

820
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,200
have to ask an exploitative question so

821
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,000
how can we measure for example

822
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,100
development speed because this is also

823
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,350
problem for example how can we measure a

824
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,900
little in relation to what in relay in

825
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,150
relation to the level software that even

826
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,720
good software for example which are the

827
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,640
measures that I can put into place okay

828
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,950
then you can have more information so

829
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,720
you know asset the phenomenon of

830
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,120
development speed but you don't know

831
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,430
when certain sentence when or how it

832
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,390
occurs so what is the development speed

833
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:42,810
actually of a child tips so specific

834
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:47,100
types specific types of teams and I want

835
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,540
to measure the I want to measure in this

836
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,280
specific case what is what is their

837
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,040
development speed in the case in which

838
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,410
you know the phenomenon and you have

839
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,740
understood it quite correctly how things

840
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,590
work in practice so you can measure you

841
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,910
can note also how things are working so

842
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,950
you've been able to measure for example

843
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,830
the develop speed of agile team you may

844
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,200
want to understand what is affecting

845
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,960
development speed so why certain teams

846
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,510
are faster than others so in this case

847
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,700
you want to understand the relationship

848
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,740
before between certain unknown causes

849
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,460
and the development speed in cases that

850
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,250
you've working towards a solution based

851
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,620
question the question can be how can I

852
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,690
improve development speed what is the

853
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,160
easiest way to improve the variable

854
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,720
speed you see that there is a

855
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,030
relationship now first as I said before

856
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,240
knowledge so first you understand what

857
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,790
effects development speed and then you

858
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,280
ask yourself how can I improve it how

859
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,070
can I move the factors so that

860
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,620
development speed increase

861
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,610
what is the easiest way to improve

862
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,420
development speed so which factors can I

863
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,960
use to somehow tune it so for example

864
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,510
pair programming I can use another

865
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,300
language or I don't know I can make

866
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,910
people work at night work at the time

867
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,490
that they want I can remove the presence

868
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,240
of the program manager I don't know

869
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,070
after I've studied the factor I can put

870
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,660
in place a solution that solved my

871
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,880
problem normally as I said before one

872
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,040
research question is not sufficient and

873
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,630
you normally need multiple question so

874
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,150
try to find after you have written down

875
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,340
some base question try to find the main

876
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,200
research question or overarching

877
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,440
research objective and then keep on

878
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,290
refinement the your type of question

879
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,840
okay and check the types of question the

880
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,270
previous table and adapt them to your

881
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,580
problem too so you start with the

882
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,620
question and you refine it you refine it

883
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,520
okay you refine it you you first go up

884
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,540
to more higher level research objective

885
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,620
and then go back and refine again so to

886
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,270
understand whether you've covered your

887
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:17,790
actual research objective and just in

888
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,860
the end very often just at the end of

889
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,610
your research you finalize the research

890
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,410
question this is something like they

891
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,370
seem to come at the beginning they

892
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,230
should come at the beginning at the

893
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,760
beginning you write some research

894
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,730
question but it is true that every time

895
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,530
you do an experiment every time you do a

896
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,290
case study anytime you study a real

897
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,570
phenomenon you understand that your

898
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:45,720
question need to be changed so your

899
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,370
research objective and your research

900
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,950
question will because stable just at the

901
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,920
end just like the requirements like the

902
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,660
requirements for a system they become

903
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,430
stable just when the system is finished

904
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,770
also the research question they get

905
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,770
transformed and transformed still even

906
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:04,650
in their form intermediate form they are

907
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:10,580
needed to guide your process so this is

908
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,710
this is all for for today

909
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:20,400
and we will we will meet again on on

910
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,180
Thursday
