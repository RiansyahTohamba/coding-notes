Maintainable JavaScript is clear, consistent, and standards-based. 
Maintainable ikut standar yg disepakati programmer bersama.
Penamaan variable, etc.

Testable JavaScript is loosely coupled, short, and isolatable. 
Testable artinya kemudahannya untuk di isolasi (isolatable). 
isolatable dicapai jika loosely coupled.

magic happens = Testable + Maintainable
Maintenance will be easy for team.
100 % coding life = write new feature + (testing and debugging).

a = some complexity is unavoidable.
b = in many cases complexity can be avoided.
b > a (in total cases).

tau mana modul yg complex.
lalu tau kenapa modul itu bisa complex.
tau mana dan kenapa bisa menurunkan complexity nya.


As always, recognizing the problem is the first step toward fixing it. It is also important to note that the algorithms your code relies on may be complex as well. 

Complex menjadi nilai jual apps kita.
Jika kode yg tdk complex, programmer lain sudah pernah buat itu.

However, unavoidable (in fact, beneficial) algorithm complexity is no excuse for writing complicated code. Although the details, and perhaps the code, surrounding your algorithm may be complex, of course there is a lot more to your application than some core algorithms.
