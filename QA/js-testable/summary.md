Recap
Automating your development, build, and deployment processes is crucial for a sane application life cycle. Fortunately, there are a lot of JavaScript tools that (mostly) fit together that can help you with this. Leveraging and melding these tools, from precommit hooks to Jenkins plug-ins, allows you to lather, rinse, and repeat as quickly as possible. Like most things, the tools are only as good as their usage. Developers must constantly be vigilant about their code and processes to ensure that everything is running smoothly and that any issues are dealt with as quickly as possible.
