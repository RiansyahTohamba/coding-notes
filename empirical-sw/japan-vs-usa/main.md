Ini Studi Survey tentang penerapan "software engineering" yang mulai digemakan sejak 1960an.
Survey ini sendiri dimulai pada tahun 1981.
berarti sudah 20 tahun an sejak SW Engineering digemakan, dan apa sajakah yang terjadi pada software production di dunia industri?
 

The IBM Corporation asked the University of
Maryland to conduct a survey of different program development environments in
industry in order to determine the state of the art in software development and to
ascertain which software engineering techniques are most effective in the nonacademic sector. This report contains the results of that survey. 

Each survey form contains two parts. 
# asks for general comments concerning software development for the organization as a whole

Section one asks for general comments concerning software development for the organization as a whole. The information described by this part typically represents the "standards and practices"
document for the organization. In addition, we also studied several recently completed projects within each company. Each such project completed the second section of the survey form, which described the tools and techniques that were used
on that particular project. 

There is currently much interest in comparing U. S. and Japanese technology. In
general, development practices are similar. 

Programmers in both countries complain about the 'amount of money' going towards hardware development and the lack of resources for software. 

However, in comparing U.S. and Japanese software
development, we found that Japanese companies typically optimize development
across the company rather than within a single project. One effect of this is that
tools become a capitalized investment paid far or developed out of company overhead rather than project funds. The cost of using tools is spread among more projects, knowledge about tools is known to more in the company, and project management is more willing to use tools since the risk is lower. Thus, tool
development and use is more widespread in Japan.
