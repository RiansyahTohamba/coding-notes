Experimentation is fundamental to any scientific and engineering endeavor. 
Understanding a discipline involves building models of the various elements of the discipline, e.g., the objects in the domain, the processes used to manipulate those objects, the relationship between the processes and the objects.

Evolving domain knowledge implies the evolution of those models by testing them via experiments of various forms. 
Analyzing the results of the experiment involves learning, the encapsulation of knowledge and the ability to change and refine our models over time. 
Therefore, our understanding of a discipline evolves over time. 
This is the paradigm that has been used in many fields, e.g., physics, medicine, manufacturing. 
These fields evolved as disciplines when they began applying the cycle of model building, experimenting, and learning. 
Each field began with recording observations and evolved to manipulating the model variables and studying the effects of changes in those variables. 
The fields differ in their nature, what constitutes the basic objects of the field, the properties of those objects, the properties of the system that contain them, the relationship of the objects to the system, and the culture of the discipline. 
These differences affect how the models are built and how experimentation gets done. 
Like other science and engineering disciplines, software engineering requires the cycle of model building, experimentation, and learning. 
The study of software engineering is a laboratory science. 
The players in the discipline are the researchers and the practitioners. 
The researcher’s role is to understand the nature of the object (products), the processes that create and manipulate them, and the relationship between the two in the context of the system. 
The practitioner’s role is to build ‘improved’ systems, using the knowledge available to date. 
These roles are symbiotic. 

The researcher needs laboratories to study the problems faced by practitioners and develop and evolve solutions based upon experimentation. The practitioner needs to understand how to build better systems and the researcher can provide models to help. In developing models and experimenting, both the researcher and the practitioner need to understand the nature of the discipline of software engineering. All software is not the same: there are a large number of variables that cause differences and their effects need to be understood. Like medicine where the variation in human genetics and medical history is often a major factor in the development of the models and the interpretation of the experiment’s results, software engineering deals with differing contexts that affect the input and the results. In software engineering the technologies are mostly human intensive rather than automated. 


Like manufacturing the major problem is understanding and improving the relationship between processes and the products they create. 
But unlike manufacturing, the process in software engineering is development not production. 
So we cannot collect data from exact repetitions of the same process.

We have to build our models at a higher level of abstraction but still take care to identify the context variables. Currently, there is an insufficient set of models that allow us to reason about the discipline, a lack of recognition of the limits of technologies for certain contexts, and insufficient analysis and experimentation going on but this latter situation is improving as evidenced by this textbook. This book is a landmark in allowing us to train both the researcher and practitioner in software engineering experimentation. It is a major contribution to the field. 

The authors have accumulated an incredible collection of knowledge and packaged it in an excellent way, providing a process for scoping, planning, running, analyzing and interpreting, and packaging experiments. They cover all necessary topics from threats to validity to statistical procedures. It is well written and covers a wide range of information necessary for performing experiments in software engineering. When I began doing experiments, I had to find various sources of information, almost always from other disciplines, and adapt them to my needs as best I could. If I had this book to help me, it would have saved me an enormous amount of time and effort and my experiments would probably have been better.

Software engineering has over the years been driven by 
1. technology development
and 
2. advocacy research. 

The latter referring to that we have invented and introduced
new methods and techniques over the years based on marketing and conviction
rather than scientific results.
