# kenapa ada di folder spec?
Kualitas sebagai salah satu kapabilitas. 
RSpec membantu software tetap 'meet the requirements'.

# Overview of the Capabilities
https://riansyahtohamba.medium.com/menjadi-seorang-insinyur-46b28d05ac4c
Menjadi seorang insinyur (engineer) berarti memahami pengetahuan apa saja yang dibutuhkan untuk menjadi insinyur. 
National Society of Professional Engineering (NSPE) membuat Body of Knowledge (BOK) di bidang Engineering.
Terdapat 30 kemampuan(kapabilitas) pada BOK engineering yang dibuat NSPE.
30 kemampuan ini di bagi menjadi 3 kategori. 

I. Basic or Foundational = [
	1. Mathematics, 
	2. Natural Sciences, 
	3. Humanities and Social Sciences
]. 

II. Technical = [ 
	4. Manufacturing/Construction, 
	5. Design, 
	6. Engineering Economics, 
	7. Engineering Science,
	8. Engineering Tools,
	9. Experiments, 
	10. Problem Recognition and Solving, 
	11. Quality Control and Quality Assurance, 
	12. Risk, Reliability, and Uncertainty, 
	13. Safety, 
	14. Societal Impact, 
	15. Systems Engineering, 
	16. Operations and Maintenance, 
	17. Sustainability and Environmental Impact, 
	18. Technical Breadth, 
	19. Technical Depth
].

III. Professional Practice = [ 
	20. Business Aspects of Engineering, 
	21. Communication, 
	22. Ethical Responsibility, 
	23. Global Knowledge and Awareness, 
	24. Leadership, 
	25. Legal Aspects of Engineering, 
	26. Lifelong Learning, 
	27. Professional Attitudes, 
	28. Project Management, 
	29. Public Policy and Engineering, 
	30. Teamwork
]. 


BOK tidak akan bisa disamakan mencakup semua jenis teknik.
Setiap teknik biasanya punya fokus tersendiri terhadap subset kapabiliti tertentu.
Makanya menyiapkan BOK untuk professional seluas ("diverse") engineering memberikan tantangan tersendiri. 

Saya sendiri tertarik dengan Quality Control & Assurance atau disingkat QA dan QC.
Lalu terdapat pembahasan mengenai Risk dan Reliability.

Quality didefinisikan sebagai Conform all requirements. 
Requirement siapa ? 
Tentu saja requirement dari user yang akan menggunakan produk yang direkayasa oleh insinyur.

Definisi panjangnya 
"quality in engineering is a measure of how well engineering services meet the client’s or customer’s needs and conform to governing criteria and current practice standards"

Sementara ini topik-topik tersebut masih saya dalami.

# natural science vs social science
Dibedakan karena apa ?

## Natural Sciences
A firm foundation in the natural sciences supports the work of engineers as they apply scientific principles to solve challenging and complex problems. 
All engineering fields are rooted in one or more of the natural sciences. 

Natural science dibagi menjadi 
1. physical and 
2. biological sciences. 

Physical sciences = [chemistry, calculus-based physics, astronomy, geology, geomorphology, hydrology] 

Biological sciences =  [living systems, biology, physiology, microbiology,  ecology]

In addition to the basic scientific literacy in the natural sciences, especially those directly supporting a given engineering field, engineers benefit from a background in natural sciences as applied to the scientific method, problem solving, and inquiry processes that develop critical thinking skills. The natural sciences also foster imagination in the engineering thought process and provide strong analytic skills and the ability to test assumptions. Through understanding of natural sciences, engineers learn how to think systematically and apply concepts of the natural sciences in the identification and solution of engineering problems.

## Humanities and Social Sciences
The humanities focus on understanding, in a qualitative manner, various aspects of individuals and society, including, but not limited to, their goals, their social nature, their values, their successes and failures, their aspirations, how all of these are expressed, and, by extension to the engineering profession, how people and the common good are served or adversely affected by technology. 

Humaniora fokus pada pemahaman, secara kualitatif, berbagai aspek individu dan masyarakat, termasuk tujuan mereka, sifat sosial mereka, value mereka, keberhasilan dan kegagalan mereka, aspirasi mereka, bagaimana semua ini diungkapkan, dan, dengan perluasan profesi insinyur, bagaimana orang dan kebaikan bersama dilayani atau dipengaruhi secara negatif oleh teknologi.
## humanities topics
Examples of humanities topics that help to develop an understanding of the human condition are 

humanities_topics =  [literature, history, languages, philosophy, religion, and visual and performing arts]
## social sciences
social sciences dan humanities sama-sama mencari pemahaman tentang kondisi human.
The social sciences also seek an improved understanding of the human condition. 
Beda social sciences vs humanities adalah pada penggunaan disiplin scientific method yang sama seperti natural sciences dan engineering.
Tahapan scientific method yang harus dilalui seperti 
1. construct theories dan hypotheses
2. observe phenomena
3. collect data
4. perform analysis

That is, the social sciences use a primarily quantitative approach. 

social sciences topics = [macroeconomics, communication studies, political science, sociology, anthropology, human geography, and psychology]

The growing importance of the humanities and the social sciences as integral elements of
successful engineering is suggested by a vision for the engineering profession as expressed by
the National Academy of Engineering in 2004: ―We aspire to [have] engineers in 2020 who will
remain well grounded in the basics of mathematics and science, and who will expand their vision
of design through a solid grounding in the humanities, social sciences, and economics.‖2 ABET,
the nongovernmental organization that accredits university programs in various disciplines,
including engineering, recognizes the engineering importance of understanding the human
condition. ABET’s accreditation criteria address the need ―to understand the impact of
engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.‖

Engineering is ultimately a people-oriented activity, both in how it is done and in its goal of
enhancing the quality of human life. The engineer must appreciate and apply aspects of the
humanities and social sciences in order to achieve the critical objective of providing valuable
service to, and improving the lives of, people. Simply stated, the humanities examine the ―what‖
of human values, and the social sciences address the ―how.‖ 
# Summary QA,QC and Risk

11. Quality Control and Quality Assurance
Relevance to the Professional Practice of Engineering : 
The measure of a project's quality is how well the results conform to all requirements

Example of a Supporting Ability : 
Apply or review quality control and/or quality assurance procedures on a project component

12. Risk, Reliability, and Uncertainty
Relevance to the Professional Practice of Engineering :
Risk, reliability, and/or uncertainty assessment is essential in engineering practice

Example of a Supporting Ability :
Apply concepts of risk, reliability, and/or uncertainty as an integral part of engineering design and decision making

# Quality Assurance
Definisi panjangnya 
"quality in engineering is a measure of how well engineering services meet the client’s or customer’s needs and conform to governing criteria and current practice standards"
